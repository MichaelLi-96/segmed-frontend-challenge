        "content": "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&#013;&#013;However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Mr. Bennet,&#x201d; said his lady to him one day, &#x201c;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But it is,&#x201d; returned she; &#x201c;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet made no answer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you not want to know who has taken it?&#x201d; cried his wife impatiently.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was invitation enough.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is his name?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Bingley.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is he married or single?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How so? How can it affect them?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Mr. Bennet,&#x201d; replied his wife, &#x201c;how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is that his design in settling here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They have none of them much to recommend them,&#x201d; replied he; &#x201c;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 2&#013;Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,&#x201d; said her mother resentfully, &#x201c;since we are not to visit.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you forget, mamma,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No more have I,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet; &#x201c;and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven&#x2019;s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,&#x201d; said her father; &#x201c;she times them ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not cough for my own amusement,&#x201d; replied Kitty fretfully. &#x201c;When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To-morrow fortnight.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Aye, so it is,&#x201d; cried her mother, &#x201c;and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I honour your circumspection. A fortnight&#x2019;s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, &#x201c;Nonsense, nonsense!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&#x201d; cried he. &#x201c;Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;While Mary is adjusting her ideas,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;let us return to Mr. Bingley.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sick of Mr. Bingley,&#x201d; cried his wife.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What an excellent father you have, girls!&#x201d; said she, when the door was shut. &#x201c;I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said Lydia stoutly, &#x201c;I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I&#x2019;m the tallest.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 3&#013;Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways&#x2014;with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s heart were entertained.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, &#x201c;and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.&#013;&#013;An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London&#x2014;his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether&#x2014;Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come, Darcy,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I would not be so fastidious as you are,&#x201d; cried Mr. Bingley, &#x201c;for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,&#x201d; said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Which do you mean?&#x201d; and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: &#x201c;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.&#013;&#013;The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane&#x2019;s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife&#x2019;s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,&#x201d; as she entered the room, &#x201c;we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If he had had any compassion for me,&#x201d; cried her husband impatiently, &#x201c;he would not have danced half so much! For God&#x2019;s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst&#x2019;s gown&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I can assure you,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 4&#013;When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is just what a young man ought to be,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!&#x2014;so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is also handsome,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear Lizzy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough&#x2014;one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design&#x2014;to take the good of everybody&#x2019;s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad&#x2014;belongs to you alone. And so you like this man&#x2019;s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly not&#x2014;at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother&#x2019;s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.&#013;&#013;His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table&#x2014;nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour&#x2014;was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.&#013;&#013;Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy&#x2019;s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.&#013;&#013;The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so&#x2014;but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 5&#013;Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James&#x2019;s had made him courteous.&#013;&#013;Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth&#x2019;s intimate friend.&#013;&#013;That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You began the evening well, Charlotte,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. &#x201c;You were Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s first choice.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her&#x2014;indeed I rather believe he did&#x2014;I heard something about it&#x2014;but I hardly know what&#x2014;something about Mr. Robinson.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson&#x2019;s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: &#x2018;Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed&#x2014;that does seem as if&#x2014;but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,&#x201d; said Charlotte. &#x201c;Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?&#x2014;poor Eliza!&#x2014;to be only just tolerable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I beg you would not put it into Lizzy&#x2019;s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you quite sure, ma&#x2019;am?&#x2014;is not there a little mistake?&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Aye&#x2014;because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bingley told me,&#x201d; said Jane, &#x201c;that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,&#x201d; said Miss Lucas, &#x201c;but I wish he had danced with Eliza.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Another time, Lizzy,&#x201d; said her mother, &#x201c;I would not dance with him, if I were you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I believe, ma&#x2019;am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His pride,&#x201d; said Miss Lucas, &#x201c;does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is very true,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pride,&#x201d; observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, &#x201c;is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,&#x201d; cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, &#x201c;I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet; &#x201c;and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 6&#013;The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet&#x2019;s pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother&#x2019;s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It may perhaps be pleasant,&#x201d; replied Charlotte, &#x201c;to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely&#x2014;a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane&#x2019;s disposition as you do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your plan is a good one,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane&#x2019;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together&#x2014;and four evenings may do a great deal.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Charlotte, &#x201c;I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.&#013;&#013;He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas&#x2019;s, where a large party were assembled.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What does Mr. Darcy mean,&#x201d; said she to Charlotte, &#x201c;by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are severe on us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It will be her turn soon to be teased,&#x201d; said Miss Lucas. &#x201c;I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!&#x2014;always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.&#x201d; On Miss Lucas&#x2019;s persevering, however, she added, &#x201c;Very well, if it must be so, it must.&#x201d; And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, &#x201c;There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: &#x2018;Keep your breath to cool your porridge&#x2019;; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.&#013;&#013;Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Sir William only smiled. &#x201c;Your friend performs delightfully,&#x201d; he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; &#x201c;and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James&#x2019;s?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Never, sir.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have a house in town, I conclude?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy bowed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself&#x2014;for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.&#x201d; And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy is all politeness,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, smiling.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance&#x2014;for who would object to such a partner?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can guess the subject of your reverie.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should imagine not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner&#x2014;in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise&#x2014;the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Elizabeth Bennet.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Elizabeth Bennet!&#x201d; repeated Miss Bingley. &#x201c;I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?&#x2014;and pray, when am I to wish you joy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady&#x2019;s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 7&#013;Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother&#x2019;s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.&#013;&#013;She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.&#013;&#013;The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner&#x2019;s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters&#x2019;, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.&#013;&#013;Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers&#x2019; names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.&#013;&#013;After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am astonished, my dear,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody&#x2019;s children, it should not be of my own, however.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well&#x2014;and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William&#x2019;s in his regimentals.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mamma,&#x201d; cried Lydia, &#x201c;my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson&#x2019;s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke&#x2019;s library.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is from Miss Bingley,&#x201d; said Jane, and then read it aloud.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;MY DEAR FRIEND,&#x2014;&#013;&#x201c;If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day&#x2019;s t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.&#x2014;Yours ever,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;CAROLINE BINGLEY&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With the officers!&#x201d; cried Lydia. &#x201c;I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dining out,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;that is very unlucky.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can I have the carriage?&#x201d; said Jane.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That would be a good scheme,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had much rather go in the coach.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if you have got them to-day,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;my mother&#x2019;s purpose will be answered.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;MY DEAREST LIZZY,&#x2014;&#013;&#x201c;I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones&#x2014;therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me&#x2014;and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.&#x2014;Yours, etc.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, my dear,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, &#x201c;if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness&#x2014;if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How can you be so silly,&#x201d; cried her mother, &#x201c;as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall be very fit to see Jane&#x2014;which is all I want.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,&#x201d; said her father, &#x201c;to send for the horses?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I admire the activity of your benevolence,&#x201d; observed Mary, &#x201c;but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We will go as far as Meryton with you,&#x201d; said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If we make haste,&#x201d; said Lydia, as they walked along, &#x201c;perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers&#x2019; wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.&#013;&#013;She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother&#x2019;s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion&#x2019;s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.&#013;&#013;Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.&#013;&#013;When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.&#013;&#013;When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 8&#013;At five o&#x2019;clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.&#013;&#013;Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.&#013;&#013;When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,&#x201d; said Bingley; &#x201c;but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley; &#x201c;and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,&#x201d; said Bingley.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,&#x201d; observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, &#x201c;that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; he replied; &#x201c;they were brightened by the exercise.&#x201d; A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is capital,&#x201d; added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,&#x201d; cried Bingley, &#x201c;it would not make them one jot less agreeable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,&#x201d; replied Darcy.&#013;&#013;To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend&#x2019;s vulgar relations.&#013;&#013;With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you prefer reading to cards?&#x201d; said he; &#x201c;that is rather singular.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Eliza Bennet,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley, &#x201c;despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth; &#x201c;I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,&#x201d; said Bingley; &#x201c;and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others&#x2014;all that his library afforded.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am astonished,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley, &#x201c;that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It ought to be good,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;it has been the work of many generations.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish it may.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am talking of possibilities, Charles.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?&#x201d; said Miss Bingley; &#x201c;will she be as tall as I am?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet&#x2019;s height, or rather taller.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is amazing to me,&#x201d; said Bingley, &#x201c;how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nor I, I am sure,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then,&#x201d; observed Elizabeth, &#x201c;you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! certainly,&#x201d; cried his faithful assistant, &#x201c;no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All this she must possess,&#x201d; added Darcy, &#x201c;and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Elizabeth Bennet,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, &#x201c;is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Undoubtedly,&#x201d; replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, &#x201c;there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother&#x2019;s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 9&#013;Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister&#x2019;s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.&#013;&#013;Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter&#x2019;s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley&#x2019;s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed I have, sir,&#x201d; was her answer. &#x201c;She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Removed!&#x201d; cried Bingley. &#x201c;It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may depend upon it, Madam,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, &#x201c;that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sure,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Whatever I do is done in a hurry,&#x201d; replied he; &#x201c;and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,&#x201d; said Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You begin to comprehend me, do you?&#x201d; cried he, turning towards her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! yes&#x2014;I understand you perfectly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy,&#x201d; cried her mother, &#x201c;remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I did not know before,&#x201d; continued Bingley immediately, &#x201c;that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The country,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, indeed,&#x201d; cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. &#x201c;I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When I am in the country,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Aye&#x2014;that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,&#x201d; looking at Darcy, &#x201c;seemed to think the country was nothing at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. &#x201c;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother&#x2019;s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did Charlotte dine with you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain&#x2014;but then she is our particular friend.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She seems a very pleasant young woman.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane&#x2019;s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane&#x2014;one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner&#x2019;s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And so ended his affection,&#x201d; said Elizabeth impatiently. &#x201c;There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,&#x201d; said Darcy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.&#013;&#013;Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle&#x2019;s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother&#x2019;s ear:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lydia declared herself satisfied. &#x201c;Oh! yes&#x2014;it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations&#x2019; behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley&#x2019;s witticisms on fine eyes.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 10&#013;The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He made no answer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You write uncommonly fast.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have already told her so once, by your desire.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thank you&#x2014;but I always mend my own.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How can you contrive to write so even?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He was silent.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley&#x2019;s.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,&#x201d; cried her brother, &#x201c;because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My style of writing is very different from yours.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; cried Miss Bingley, &#x201c;Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them&#x2014;by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your humility, Mr. Bingley,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;must disarm reproof.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing is more deceitful,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself&#x2014;and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nay,&#x201d; cried Bingley, &#x201c;this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, &#x2018;Bingley, you had better stay till next week,&#x2019; you would probably do it, you would probably not go&#x2014;and at another word, might stay a month.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have only proved by this,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, &#x201c;that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am exceedingly gratified,&#x201d; said Bingley, &#x201c;by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To yield readily&#x2014;easily&#x2014;to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;By all means,&#x201d; cried Bingley; &#x201c;let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I see your design, Bingley,&#x201d; said his friend. &#x201c;You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What you ask,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.&#013;&#013;When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.&#013;&#013;After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all&#x2014;and now despise me if you dare.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed I do not dare.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I hope,&#x201d; said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, &#x201c;you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth&#x2019;s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I did not know that you intended to walk,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You used us abominably ill,&#x201d; answered Mrs. Hurst, &#x201c;running away without telling us that you were coming out.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 11&#013;When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.&#013;&#013;But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley&#x2019;s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was &#x201c;very glad;&#x201d; but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley&#x2019;s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.&#013;&#013;When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table&#x2014;but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother&#x2019;s conversation with Miss Bennet.&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley&#x2019;s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, &#x201c;How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you mean Darcy,&#x201d; cried her brother, &#x201c;he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins&#x2014;but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should like balls infinitely better,&#x201d; she replied, &#x201c;if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. &#x201c;What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?&#x201d;&#x2014;and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; was her answer; &#x201c;but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,&#x201d; said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. &#x201c;You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other&#x2019;s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! shocking!&#x201d; cried Miss Bingley. &#x201c;I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,&#x201d; said Elizabeth. &#x201c;We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him&#x2014;laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth. &#x201c;That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bingley,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men&#x2014;nay, the wisest and best of their actions&#x2014;may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth&#x2014;&#x201c;there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Such as vanity and pride.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride&#x2014;where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,&#x201d; said Miss Bingley; &#x201c;and pray what is the result?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding&#x2014;certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is a failing indeed!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth. &#x201c;Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil&#x2014;a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And your defect is to hate everybody.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And yours,&#x201d; he replied with a smile, &#x201c;is willfully to misunderstand them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do let us have a little music,&#x201d; cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. &#x201c;Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments&#x2019; recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 12&#013;In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane&#x2019;s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth&#x2019;s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved&#x2014;nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.&#013;&#013;The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.&#013;&#013;The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her&#x2014;that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.&#013;&#013;To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence&#x2014;Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked&#x2014;and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.&#013;&#013;On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley&#x2019;s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.&#013;&#013;They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 13&#013;&#x201c;I hope, my dear,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, &#x201c;that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in&#x2014;and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s eyes sparkled. &#x201c;A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But&#x2014;good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell&#x2014;I must speak to Hill this moment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is not Mr. Bingley,&#x201d; said her husband; &#x201c;it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.&#013;&#013;After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! my dear,&#x201d; cried his wife, &#x201c;I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet, &#x201c;and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear Sir,&#x2014;&#013;&#x201c;The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.&#x2014;&#x2018;There, Mrs. Bennet.&#x2019;&#x2014;My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends&#x2014;but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o&#x2019;clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se&#x2019;ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.&#x2014;I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;WILLIAM COLLINS&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;At four o&#x2019;clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. &#x201c;He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Though it is difficult,&#x201d; said Jane, &#x201c;to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He must be an oddity, I think,&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;I cannot make him out.&#x2014;There is something very pompous in his style.&#x2014;And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?&#x2014;We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.&#x2014;Could he be a sensible man, sir?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In point of composition,&#x201d; said Mary, &#x201c;the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins&#x2019;s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins&#x2019;s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 14&#013;During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh&#x2019;s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that &#x201c;he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank&#x2014;such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself&#x2014;some shelves in the closet up stairs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship&#x2019;s residence.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, &#x201c;then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You judge very properly,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet, &#x201c;and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.&#013;&#013;By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce&#x2019;s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia&#x2019;s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 15&#013;Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.&#013;&#013;Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends&#x2014;of atonement&#x2014;for inheriting their father&#x2019;s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.&#013;&#013;His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet&#x2019;s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour&#x2019;s t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. &#x201c;As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say&#x2014;she could not positively answer&#x2014;but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention&#x2014;she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth&#x2014;and it was soon done&#x2014;done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.&#013;&#013;Lydia&#x2019;s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.&#013;&#013;In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.&#013;&#013;But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger&#x2019;s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation&#x2014;a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat&#x2014;a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.&#013;&#013;In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.&#013;&#013;Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip&#x2019;s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia&#x2019;s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips&#x2019;s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones&#x2019;s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane&#x2019;s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant&#x2019;s commission in the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become &#x201c;stupid, disagreeable fellows.&#x201d; Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.&#013;&#013;As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips&#x2019;s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 16&#013;As no objection was made to the young people&#x2019;s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins&#x2019;s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle&#x2019;s invitation, and was then in the house.&#013;&#013;When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor&#x2014;when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper&#x2019;s room.&#013;&#013;In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.&#013;&#013;Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.&#013;&#013;With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know little of the game at present,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life&#x2014;&#x201d; Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.&#013;&#013;Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia&#x2019;s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told&#x2014;the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;About a month,&#x201d; said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, &#x201c;He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; replied Mr. Wickham; &#x201c;his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not but look surprised.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As much as I ever wish to be,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth very warmly. &#x201c;I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have no right to give my opinion,&#x201d; said Wickham, &#x201c;as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish&#x2014;and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot pretend to be sorry,&#x201d; said Wickham, after a short interruption, &#x201c;that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.&#x201d; Wickham only shook his head.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, &#x201c;whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! no&#x2014;it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.&#013;&#013;Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;which was my chief inducement to enter the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession&#x2014;I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good heavens!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth; &#x201c;but how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it&#x2014;or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence&#x2014;in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Some time or other he will be&#x2014;but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But what,&#x201d; said she, after a pause, &#x201c;can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A thorough, determined dislike of me&#x2014;a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father&#x2019;s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood&#x2014;the sort of preference which was often given me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this&#x2014;though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;After a few minutes&#x2019; reflection, however, she continued, &#x201c;I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will not trust myself on the subject,&#x201d; replied Wickham; &#x201c;I can hardly be just to him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, &#x201c;To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!&#x201d; She could have added, &#x201c;A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable&#x201d;&#x2014;but she contented herself with, &#x201c;and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to&#x2014;but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father&#x2019;s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father&#x2019;s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How strange!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth. &#x201c;How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest&#x2014;for dishonesty I must call it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is wonderful,&#x201d; replied Wickham, &#x201c;for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride&#x2014;for he is very proud of what his father was&#x2014;have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He shook his head. &#x201c;I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother&#x2014;very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father&#x2019;s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable&#x2014;allowing something for fortune and figure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know very well, madam,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lady Catherine de Bourgh,&#x201d; she replied, &#x201c;has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Collins,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I believe her to be both in a great degree,&#x201d; replied Wickham; &#x201c;I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips&#x2019;s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 17&#013;Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They have both,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father&#x2019;s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is difficult indeed&#x2014;it is distressing. One does not know what to think.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But Jane could think with certainty on only one point&#x2014;that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.&#013;&#013;The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s civilities.&#013;&#013;The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;While I can have my mornings to myself,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;it is enough&#x2014;I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening&#x2019;s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins&#x2019;s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.&#013;&#013;If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after&#x2014;the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 18&#013;Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s pleasure in the Bingleys&#x2019; invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, &#x201c;I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham&#x2019;s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.&#013;&#013;But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.&#013;&#013;She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I dare say you will find him very agreeable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours&#x2019; looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:&#x2014;&#x201c;It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Both,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth archly; &#x201c;for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the &eacute;clat of a proverb.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,&#x201d; said he. &#x201c;How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must not decide on my own performance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, &#x201c;When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, &#x201c;Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends&#x2014;whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth with emphasis, &#x201c;and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:&#x2014;but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William&#x2019;s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, &#x201c;Sir William&#x2019;s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What think you of books?&#x201d; said he, smiling.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Books&#x2014;oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No&#x2014;I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The present always occupies you in such scenes&#x2014;does it?&#x201d; said he, with a look of doubt.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, always,&#x201d; she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, &#x201c;I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; said he, with a firm voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I hope not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May I ask to what these questions tend?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Merely to the illustration of your character,&#x201d; said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. &#x201c;I am trying to make it out.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what is your success?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She shook her head. &#x201c;I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can readily believe,&#x201d; answered he gravely, &#x201c;that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,&#x201d; he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy&#x2019;s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.&#013;&#013;They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite&#x2019;s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,&#x201d; said Elizabeth angrily; &#x201c;for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I beg your pardon,&#x201d; replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. &#x201c;Excuse my interference&#x2014;it was kindly meant.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Insolent girl!&#x201d; said Elizabeth to herself. &#x201c;You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.&#x201d; She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane&#x2019;s being in the fairest way for happiness.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I want to know,&#x201d; said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister&#x2019;s, &#x201c;what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; replied Jane, &#x201c;I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister&#x2019;s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s regard.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s sincerity,&#x201d; said Elizabeth warmly; &#x201c;but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have found out,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine&#x2019;s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&#x2019;nnight.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom&#x2014;provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.&#x201d; And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words &#x201c;apology,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hunsford,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&#x201d; It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have no reason, I assure you,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley&#x2019;s two sisters. Her mother&#x2019;s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane&#x2019;s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.&#013;&#013;In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother&#x2019;s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;For heaven&#x2019;s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.&#013;&#013;At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary&#x2019;s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, &#x201c;That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father&#x2019;s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If I,&#x201d; said Mr. Collins, &#x201c;were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.&#x201d; And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared&#x2014;many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.&#013;&#013;To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.&#013;&#013;The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins&#x2019;s conversation to herself.&#013;&#013;She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.&#013;&#013;The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of &#x201c;Lord, how tired I am!&#x201d; accompanied by a violent yawn.&#013;&#013;When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 19&#013;The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, &#x201c;Oh dear!&#x2014;yes&#x2014;certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy&#x2014;I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.&#x201d; And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.&#x201d; And upon Elizabeth&#x2019;s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: &#x201c;Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction&#x2014;and a moment&#x2019;s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother&#x2019;s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying&#x2014;and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly&#x2014;which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford&#x2014;between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh&#x2019;s footstool, that she said, &#x2018;Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.&#x2019; Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place&#x2014;which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother&#x2019;s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are too hasty, sir,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am not now to learn,&#x201d; replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, &#x201c;that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word, sir,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, &#x201c;your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,&#x201d; said Mr. Collins very gravely&#x2014;&#x201c;but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.&#x201d; And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Really, Mr. Collins,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, &#x201c;you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are uniformly charming!&#x201d; cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; &#x201c;and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 20&#013;Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.&#013;&#013;This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,&#x201d; cried Mr. Collins; &#x201c;but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sir, you quite misunderstand me,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. &#x201c;Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, &#x201c;Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have not the pleasure of understanding you,&#x201d; said he, when she had finished her speech. &#x201c;Of what are you talking?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come here, child,&#x201d; cried her father as she appeared. &#x201c;I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?&#x201d; Elizabeth replied that it was. &#x201c;Very well&#x2014;and this offer of marriage you have refused?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have, sir.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, or I will never see her again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear,&#x201d; replied her husband, &#x201c;I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother&#x2019;s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.&#013;&#013;While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, &#x201c;I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. &#x201c;Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,&#x201d; she added in a melancholy tone, &#x201c;for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Charlotte&#x2019;s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Aye, there she comes,&#x201d; continued Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy&#x2014;if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all&#x2014;and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you&#x2014;and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, &#x201c;Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: &#x201c;Oh! Mr. Collins!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear madam,&#x201d; replied he, &#x201c;let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me,&#x201d; he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, &#x201c;to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter&#x2019;s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter&#x2019;s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 21&#013;The discussion of Mr. Collins&#x2019;s offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.&#013;&#013;The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.&#013;&#013;After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt&#x2019;s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I found,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.&#013;&#013;Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady&#x2019;s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister&#x2019;s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town&#x2014;and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: &#x201c;I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.&#x201d; To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is unlucky,&#x201d; said she, after a short pause, &#x201c;that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd&#x2014;but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is evident by this,&#x201d; added Jane, &#x201c;that he comes back no more this winter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister&#x2019;s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman&#x2019;s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?&#x201d; said Jane as she finished it. &#x201c;Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother&#x2019;s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Most willingly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane shook her head.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,&#x201d; replied Jane, &#x201c;your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must decide for yourself,&#x201d; said Elizabeth; &#x201c;and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How can you talk so?&#x201d; said Jane, faintly smiling. &#x201c;You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline&#x2019;s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.&#013;&#013;She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane&#x2019;s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.&#013;&#013;They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman&#x2019;s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 22&#013;The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. &#x201c;It keeps him in good humour,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&#x201d; Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte&#x2019;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins&#x2019;s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas&#x2019;s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.&#013;&#013;In as short a time as Mr. Collins&#x2019;s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.&#013;&#013;Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins&#x2019;s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James&#x2019;s. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte&#x2019;s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.&#013;&#013;As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear madam,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But is there not danger of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear sir,&#x201d; replied Mr. Collins, &#x201c;I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship&#x2019;s concurrence.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.&#013;&#013;The possibility of Mr. Collins&#x2019;s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte&#x2014;impossible!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman&#x2019;s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I see what you are feeling,&#x201d; replied Charlotte. &#x201c;You must be surprised, very much surprised&#x2014;so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins&#x2019;s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth quietly answered &#x201c;Undoubtedly;&#x201d; and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&#x2019;s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte&#x2019;s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 23&#013;Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter&#x2014;to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William&#x2019;s good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!&#013;&#013;Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.&#013;&#013;Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.&#013;&#013;Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.&#013;&#013;Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth&#x2019;s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins&#x2019;s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s continued absence.&#013;&#013;Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.&#013;&#013;Even Elizabeth began to fear&#x2014;not that Bingley was indifferent&#x2014;but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane&#x2019;s happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.&#013;&#013;As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth&#x2019;s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane&#x2019;s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, Mr. Bennet,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What should not you mind?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should not mind anything at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one&#x2019;s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should he have it more than anybody else?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I leave it to yourself to determine,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 24&#013;Miss Bingley&#x2019;s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother&#x2019;s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.&#013;&#013;Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy&#x2019;s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother&#x2019;s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline&#x2019;s assertion of her brother&#x2019;s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister&#x2019;s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley&#x2019;s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends&#x2019; interference; whether he had been aware of Jane&#x2019;s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister&#x2019;s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.&#013;&#013;A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You doubt me,&#x201d; cried Jane, slightly colouring; &#x201c;indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore&#x2014;I shall certainly try to get the better.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;With a stronger voice she soon added, &#x201c;I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Jane!&#x201d; exclaimed Elizabeth, &#x201c;you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister&#x2019;s warm affection.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nay,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte&#x2019;s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins&#x2019;s respectability, and Charlotte&#x2019;s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody&#x2019;s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,&#x201d; replied Jane; &#x201c;and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And men take care that they should.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s conduct to design,&#x201d; said Elizabeth; &#x201c;but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people&#x2019;s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And do you impute it to either of those?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, in conjunction with his friend.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,&#x201d; replied Jane; &#x201c;but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother&#x2019;s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken&#x2014;or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. &#x201c;So, Lizzy,&#x201d; said he one day, &#x201c;your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane&#x2019;s good fortune.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;True,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet, &#x201c;but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes&#x2014;but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 25&#013;After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.&#013;&#013;On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.&#013;&#013;The first part of Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not blame Jane,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins&#x2019;s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth&#x2019;s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.&#013;&#013;When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. &#x201c;It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;An excellent consolation in its way,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But that expression of &#x2018;violently in love&#x2019; is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour&#x2019;s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s love?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes!&#x2014;of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service&#x2014;and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister&#x2019;s ready acquiescence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I hope,&#x201d; added Mrs. Gardiner, &#x201c;that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month&#x2019;s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She will drop the acquaintance entirely.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley&#x2019;s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane&#x2019;s attractions.&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet accepted her aunt&#x2019;s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline&#x2019;s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.&#013;&#013;The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it&#x2014;of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth&#x2019;s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.&#013;&#013;To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy&#x2019;s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman&#x2019;s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 26&#013;Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Elizabeth, you are not serious now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw&#x2014;and if he becomes really attached to me&#x2014;I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father&#x2019;s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As I did the other day,&#x201d; said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: &#x201c;very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother&#x2019;s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she &#x201c;wished they might be happy.&#x201d; Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother&#x2019;s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That you certainly shall.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My father and Maria are coming to me in March,&#x201d; added Charlotte, &#x201c;and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte&#x2019;s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine&#x2019;s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins&#x2019;s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.&#013;&#013;Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.&#013;&#013;Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My aunt,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. &#x201c;I did not think Caroline in spirits,&#x201d; were her words, &#x201c;but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister&#x2019;s being in town.&#013;&#013;Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley&#x2019;s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley&#x2019;s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy&#x2014;your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.&#x2014;Yours, etc.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s sister, as by Wickham&#x2019;s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte&#x2019;s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.&#013;&#013;All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: &#x201c;I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 27&#013;With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte&#x2019;s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.&#013;&#013;The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.&#013;&#013;The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her&#x2014;their opinion of everybody&#x2014;would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.&#013;&#013;Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William&#x2019;s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.&#013;&#013;It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner&#x2019;s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin&#x2019;s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley&#x2019;s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham&#x2019;s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But my dear Elizabeth,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather&#x2019;s death made her mistress of this fortune.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No&#x2014;why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient in something herself&#x2014;sense or feeling.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, &#x201c;have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have not determined how far it shall carry us,&#x201d; said Mrs. Gardiner, &#x201c;but, perhaps, to the Lakes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. &#x201c;Oh, my dear, dear aunt,&#x201d; she rapturously cried, &#x201c;what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone&#x2014;we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 28&#013;Every object in the next day&#x2019;s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.&#013;&#013;When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.&#013;&#013;At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin&#x2019;s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife&#x2019;s offers of refreshment.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.&#013;&#013;From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband&#x2019;s help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte&#x2019;s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.&#013;&#013;She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship&#x2019;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship&#x2019;s carriages, for she has several.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,&#x201d; added Charlotte, &#x201c;and a most attentive neighbour.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte&#x2019;s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.&#013;&#013;About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And is this all?&#x201d; cried Elizabeth. &#x201c;I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;La! my dear,&#x201d; said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, &#x201c;it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I like her appearance,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. &#x201c;She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth&#x2019;s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.&#013;&#013;At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 29&#013;Mr. Collins&#x2019;s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I confess,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship&#x2019;s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am the less surprised at what has happened,&#x201d; replied Sir William, &#x201c;from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.&#013;&#013;When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest&#x2014;there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James&#x2019;s.&#013;&#013;As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.&#013;&#013;When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria&#x2019;s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth&#x2019;s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.&#013;&#013;From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.&#013;&#013;In spite of having been at St. James&#x2019;s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.&#013;&#013;When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria&#x2019;s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.&#013;&#013;After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.&#013;&#013;The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship&#x2019;s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh&#x2014;the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.&#013;&#013;When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte&#x2019;s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady&#x2019;s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother&#x2019;s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your father&#x2019;s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,&#x201d; turning to Charlotte, &#x201c;I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh&#x2019;s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A little.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! then&#x2014;some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to&#x2014;&#x2014;You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;One of them does.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, not at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What, none of you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not one.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Has your governess left you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We never had any governess.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf&#x2019;s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &#x2018;Lady Catherine,&#x2019; said she, &#x2018;you have given me a treasure.&#x2019; Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma&#x2019;am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word,&#x201d; said her ladyship, &#x201c;you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With three younger sisters grown up,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, smiling, &#x201c;your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am not one-and-twenty.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh&#x2019;s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking&#x2014;stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.&#013;&#013;When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins&#x2019;s side and as many bows on Sir William&#x2019;s they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte&#x2019;s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship&#x2019;s praise into his own hands.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 30&#013;Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter&#x2019;s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.&#013;&#013;From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes&#x2019; conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.&#013;&#013;Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins&#x2019;s joints of meat were too large for her family.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.&#013;&#013;The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins&#x2019;s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s curiosity.&#013;&#013;In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley&#x2019;s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.&#013;&#013;His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord &#x2014;&#x2014;, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband&#x2019;s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire&#x2014;paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.&#013;&#013;Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment&#x2019;s pause, added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 31&#013;Colonel Fitzwilliam&#x2019;s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither&#x2014;for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen&#x2019;s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.&#013;&#013;The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine&#x2019;s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.&#013;&#013;Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins&#x2019;s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are speaking of music, madam,&#x201d; said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister&#x2019;s proficiency.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,&#x201d; said Lady Catherine; &#x201c;and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I assure you, madam,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson&#x2019;s room. She would be in nobody&#x2019;s way, you know, in that part of the house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt&#x2019;s ill-breeding, and made no answer.&#013;&#013;When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer&#x2019;s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall not say you are mistaken,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, &#x201c;Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire&#x2014;and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too&#x2014;for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am not afraid of you,&#x201d; said he, smilingly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,&#x201d; cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. &#x201c;I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You shall hear then&#x2014;but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball&#x2014;and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?&#x201d; said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. &#x201c;Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can answer your question,&#x201d; said Fitzwilliam, &#x201c;without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My fingers,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women&#x2019;s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault&#x2014;because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman&#x2019;s of superior execution.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy smiled and said, &#x201c;You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne&#x2019;s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin&#x2019;s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth&#x2019;s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship&#x2019;s carriage was ready to take them all home.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 32&#013;Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.&#013;&#013;He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within.&#013;&#013;They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perfectly so, I thank you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should not be surprised,&#x201d; said Darcy, &#x201c;if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.&#013;&#013;He took the hint, and soon began with, &#x201c;This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I believe she did&#x2014;and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding&#x2014;though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day&#x2019;s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth. &#x201c;I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys&#x2014;and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, &#x201c;You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you pleased with Kent?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise&#x2014;and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What can be the meaning of this?&#x201d; said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. &#x201c;My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte&#x2019;s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam&#x2019;s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.&#013;&#013;But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice&#x2014;a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam&#x2019;s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.&#013;&#013;She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend&#x2019;s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.&#013;&#013;In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 33&#013;More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions&#x2014;about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins&#x2019;s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.&#013;&#013;She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane&#x2019;s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I did not know before that you ever walked this way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have been making the tour of the park,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I should have turned in a moment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?&#x201d; said she.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He likes to have his own way very well,&#x201d; replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. &#x201c;But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;These are home questions&#x2014;and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is this,&#x201d; thought Elizabeth, &#x201c;meant for me?&#x201d; and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, &#x201c;And pray, what is the usual price of an earl&#x2019;s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Colonel Fitzwilliam, &#x201c;that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man&#x2014;he is a great friend of Darcy&#x2019;s.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! yes,&#x201d; said Elizabeth drily; &#x201c;Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is it you mean?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady&#x2019;s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may depend upon my not mentioning it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what arts did he use to separate them?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He did not talk to me of his own arts,&#x201d; said Fitzwilliam, smiling. &#x201c;He only told me what I have now told you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am thinking of what you have been telling me,&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;Your cousin&#x2019;s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend&#x2019;s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But,&#x201d; she continued, recollecting herself, &#x201c;as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is not an unnatural surmise,&#x201d; said Fitzwilliam, &#x201c;but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin&#x2019;s triumph very sadly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There were some very strong objections against the lady,&#x201d; were Colonel Fitzwilliam&#x2019;s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To Jane herself,&#x201d; she exclaimed, &#x201c;there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!&#x2014;her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.&#x201d; When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend&#x2019;s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.&#013;&#013;The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s being rather displeased by her staying at home.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 34&#013;When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister&#x2019;s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next&#x2014;and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.&#013;&#013;She could not think of Darcy&#x2019;s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.&#013;&#013;While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority&#x2014;of its being a degradation&#x2014;of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.&#013;&#013;In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man&#x2019;s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot&#x2014;I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth&#x2019;s feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I might as well inquire,&#x201d; replied she, &#x201c;why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you&#x2014;had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other&#x2014;of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can you deny that you have done it?&#x201d; she repeated.&#013;&#013;With assumed tranquillity he then replied: &#x201c;I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But it is not merely this affair,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You take an eager interest in that gentleman&#x2019;s concerns,&#x201d; said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His misfortunes!&#x201d; repeated Darcy contemptuously; &#x201c;yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And of your infliction,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth with energy. &#x201c;You have reduced him to his present state of poverty&#x2014;comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And this,&#x201d; cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, &#x201c;is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,&#x201d; added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, &#x201c;these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?&#x2014;to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;From the very beginning&#x2014;from the first moment, I may almost say&#x2014;of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.&#013;&#013;The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend&#x2019;s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case&#x2014;was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride&#x2014;his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane&#x2014;his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine&#x2019;s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte&#x2019;s observation, and hurried her away to her room.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 35&#013;Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.&#013;&#013;After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, &#x201c;I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?&#x201d; And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.&#013;&#013;With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning, and was as follows:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas&#x2019;s accidental information, that Bingley&#x2019;s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend&#x2019;s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening&#x2019;s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister&#x2019;s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain&#x2014;but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother&#x2019;s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters&#x2019; uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went&#x2014;and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister&#x2019;s indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister&#x2019;s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister&#x2019;s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge&#x2014;most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman&#x2019;s education. My father was not only fond of this young man&#x2019;s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities&#x2014;the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain&#x2014;to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character&#x2014;it adds even another motive.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow&#x2014;and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled&#x2014;he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question&#x2014;of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father&#x2019;s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances&#x2014;and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother&#x2019;s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister&#x2019;s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s chief object was unquestionably my sister&#x2019;s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father&#x2019;s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;FITZWILLIAM DARCY&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 36&#013;If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister&#x2019;s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.&#013;&#013;But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham&#x2014;when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself&#x2014;her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, &#x201c;This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!&#x201d;&#x2014;and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.&#013;&#013;In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham&#x2019;s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality&#x2014;deliberated on the probability of each statement&#x2014;but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.&#013;&#013;The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years&#x2019; continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself&#x2014;from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin&#x2019;s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin&#x2019;s corroboration.&#013;&#013;She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips&#x2019;s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy&#x2014;that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.&#013;&#013;How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance&#x2014;an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways&#x2014;seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust&#x2014;anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued&#x2014;that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.&#013;&#013;She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How despicably I have acted!&#x201d; she cried; &#x201c;I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;From herself to Jane&#x2014;from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister&#x2019;s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte&#x2019;s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane&#x2019;s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.&#013;&#013;When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.&#013;&#013;The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane&#x2019;s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.&#013;&#013;After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought&#x2014;re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.&#013;&#013;She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave&#x2014;but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 37&#013;The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship&#x2019;s indignation would have been. &#x201c;What would she have said? how would she have behaved?&#x201d; were questions with which she amused herself.&#013;&#013;Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. &#x201c;I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,&#x201d; said Lady Catherine; &#x201c;I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you&#x2014;and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine seemed resigned. &#x201c;Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My uncle is to send a servant for us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother&#x2019;s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia&#x2019;s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.&#013;&#013;Anxiety on Jane&#x2019;s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!&#013;&#013;When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham&#x2019;s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.&#013;&#013;Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.&#013;&#013;When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 38&#013;On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know not, Miss Elizabeth,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine&#x2019;s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine&#x2019;s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate&#x2014;but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.&#013;&#013;At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good gracious!&#x201d; cried Maria, after a few minutes&#x2019; silence, &#x201c;it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A great many indeed,&#x201d; said her companion with a sigh.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth added privately, &#x201c;And how much I shall have to conceal!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner&#x2019;s house, where they were to remain a few days.&#013;&#013;Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.&#013;&#013;It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 39&#013;It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of &#x2014;&#x2014;, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman&#x2019;s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.&#013;&#013;After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, &#x201c;Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And we mean to treat you all,&#x201d; added Lydia, &#x201c;but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.&#x201d; Then, showing her purchases&#x2014;&#x201c;Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, &#x201c;Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are they indeed!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; thought Elizabeth, &#x201c;that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now I have got some news for you,&#x201d; said Lydia, as they sat down at table. &#x201c;What do you think? It is excellent news&#x2014;capital news&#x2014;and about a certain person we all like!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham&#x2019;s marrying Mary King. There&#x2019;s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And Mary King is safe!&#x201d; added Elizabeth; &#x201c;safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,&#x201d; said Jane.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her&#x2014;who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!&#013;&#013;As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty&#x2019;s and Lydia&#x2019;s purchases, were seated in it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How nicely we are all crammed in,&#x201d; cried Lydia. &#x201c;I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can&#x2019;t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster&#x2019;s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman&#x2019;s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty&#x2019;s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham&#x2019;s name.&#013;&#013;Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person&#x2019;s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! Mary,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To this Mary very gravely replied, &#x201c;Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me&#x2014;I should infinitely prefer a book.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.&#013;&#013;In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her of the regiment&#x2019;s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go&#x2014;and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.&#013;&#013;She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 40&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet&#x2019;s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister&#x2019;s refusal must have given him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Blame you! Oh, no.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No&#x2014;I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy&#x2019;s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This will not do,&#x201d; said Elizabeth; &#x201c;you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy&#x2019;s; but you shall do as you choose.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not know when I have been more shocked,&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one&#x2019;s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham&#x2019;s character.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, &#x201c;Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The tumult of Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. &#x201c;And then,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister&#x2019;s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, Lizzy,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet one day, &#x201c;what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane&#x2019;s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man&#x2014;and I do not suppose there&#x2019;s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, Lizzy,&#x201d; continued her mother, soon afterwards, &#x201c;and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, nothing at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was a subject which they could not mention before me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 41&#013;The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment&#x2019;s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?&#x201d; would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. &#x201c;How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sure,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller&#x2019;s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sure I shall break mine,&#x201d; said Lydia.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If one could but go to Brighton!&#x201d; observed Mrs. Bennet.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes!&#x2014;if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,&#x201d; added Kitty.&#013;&#013;Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.&#013;&#013;But the gloom of Lydia&#x2019;s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months&#x2019; acquaintance they had been intimate two.&#013;&#013;The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister&#x2019;s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone&#x2019;s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia&#x2019;s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you were aware,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia&#x2019;s unguarded and imprudent manner&#x2014;nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Already arisen?&#x201d; repeated Mr. Bennet. &#x201c;What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia&#x2019;s folly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia&#x2019;s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of&#x2014;or I may say, three&#x2014;very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.&#013;&#013;Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia&#x2019;s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp&#x2014;its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.&#013;&#013;Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia&#x2019;s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband&#x2019;s never intending to go there himself.&#013;&#013;But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia&#x2019;s leaving home.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.&#013;&#013;On the very last day of the regiment&#x2019;s remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam&#x2019;s and Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.&#013;&#013;He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment&#x2019;s recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How long did you say he was at Rosings?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nearly three weeks.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And you saw him frequently?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, almost every day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His manners are very different from his cousin&#x2019;s.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed!&#x201d; cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. &#x201c;And pray, may I ask?&#x2014;&#x201d; But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, &#x201c;Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?&#x2014;for I dare not hope,&#x201d; he continued in a lower and more serious tone, &#x201c;that he is improved in essentials.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; said Elizabeth. &#x201c;In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wickham&#x2019;s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.&#013;&#013;When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible&#x2014;advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 42&#013;Had Elizabeth&#x2019;s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father&#x2019;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.&#013;&#013;When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham&#x2019;s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity&#x2014;to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But it is fortunate,&#x201d; thought she, &#x201c;that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister&#x2019;s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt&#x2014;for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.&#013;&#013;After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.&#013;&#013;The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied&#x2014;and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.&#013;&#013;With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. &#x201c;But surely,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt&#x2019;s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way&#x2014;teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.&#013;&#013;The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain&#x2014;that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences&#x2014;cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure&#x2014;and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.&#013;&#013;It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?&#x201d; said her aunt; &#x201c;a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. &#x201c;If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth said no more&#x2014;but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.&#013;&#013;Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question&#x2014;and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 43&#013;Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.&#013;&#013;The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!&#013;&#013;They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.&#013;&#013;The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And of this place,&#x201d; thought she, &#x201c;I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,&#x201d;&#x2014;recollecting herself&#x2014;&#x201c;that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was a lucky recollection&#x2014;it saved her from something very like regret.&#013;&#013;She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, &#x201c;But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.&#x201d; How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!&#013;&#013;Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master&#x2019;s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. &#x201c;He is now gone into the army,&#x201d; she added; &#x201c;but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And that,&#x201d; said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, &#x201c;is my master&#x2014;and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other&#x2014;about eight years ago.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have heard much of your master&#x2019;s fine person,&#x201d; said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; &#x201c;it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth coloured, and said: &#x201c;A little.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, very handsome.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master&#x2019;s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s being among them.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?&#x201d; said Mrs. Gardiner.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! yes&#x2014;the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!&#x2014;She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her&#x2014;a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Except,&#x201d; thought Elizabeth, &#x201c;when she goes to Ramsgate.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If your master would marry, you might see more of him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, &#x201c;It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,&#x201d; replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, &#x201c;I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth almost stared at her. &#x201c;Can this be Mr. Darcy?&#x201d; thought she.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His father was an excellent man,&#x201d; said Mrs. Gardiner.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him&#x2014;just as affable to the poor.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is the best landlord, and the best master,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In what an amiable light does this place him!&#x201d; thought Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This fine account of him,&#x201d; whispered her aunt as they walked, &#x201c;is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps we might be deceived.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is not very likely; our authority was too good.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is certainly a good brother,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy&#x2019;s delight, when she should enter the room. &#x201c;And this is always the way with him,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy&#x2019;s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.&#013;&#013;In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her&#x2014;and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father&#x2019;s lifetime.&#013;&#013;There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people&#x2019;s happiness were in his guardianship!&#x2014;how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!&#x2014;how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.&#013;&#013;When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.&#013;&#013;As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.&#013;&#013;They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.&#013;&#013;She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener&#x2019;s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.&#013;&#013;At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.&#013;&#013;The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived&#x2014;that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered&#x2014;what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!&#x2014;but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.&#013;&#013;They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind&#x2014;in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.&#013;&#013;At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.&#013;&#013;They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth&#x2019;s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words &#x201c;delightful,&#x201d; and &#x201c;charming,&#x201d; when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. &#x201c;What will be his surprise,&#x201d; thought she, &#x201c;when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.&#013;&#013;The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, &#x201c;Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me&#x2014;it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth&#x2019;s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband&#x2019;s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected&#x2014;&#x201c;for your housekeeper,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.&#x201d; He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. &#x201c;They will join me early to-morrow,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you&#x2014;Mr. Bingley and his sisters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is also one other person in the party,&#x201d; he continued after a pause, &#x201c;who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.&#013;&#013;They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.&#013;&#013;He then asked her to walk into the house&#x2014;but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly&#x2014;and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te was over.&#013;&#013;On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.&#013;&#013;The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. &#x201c;He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,&#x201d; said her uncle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,&#x201d; replied her aunt, &#x201c;but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To be sure, Lizzy,&#x201d; said her aunt, &#x201c;he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham&#x2019;s countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,&#x201d; replied her uncle. &#x201c;Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;From what we have seen of him,&#x201d; continued Mrs. Gardiner, &#x201c;I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham&#x2019;s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning&#x2019;s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years&#x2019; discontinuance.&#013;&#013;The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 44&#013;Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth&#x2019;s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.&#013;&#013;She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.&#013;&#013;Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.&#013;&#013;Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.&#013;&#013;They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley&#x2019;s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth&#x2019;s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.&#013;&#013;To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady&#x2019;s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.&#013;&#013;In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it &#x201c;was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;&#x201d; and, before she could reply, he added, &#x201c;It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.&#013;&#013;It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace&#x2014;when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage&#x2014;the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.&#013;&#013;Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.&#013;&#013;Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.&#013;&#013;But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.&#013;&#013;Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant&#x2019;s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.&#013;&#013;With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.&#013;&#013;As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude&#x2014;for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.&#013;&#013;It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy&#x2019;s in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.&#013;&#013;Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 45&#013;Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley&#x2019;s dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady&#x2019;s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.&#013;&#013;On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.&#013;&#013;In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana&#x2019;s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.&#013;&#013;By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley&#x2019;s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.&#013;&#013;The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party&#x2014;for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.&#013;&#013;While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.&#013;&#013;He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley&#x2019;s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother&#x2019;s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In Darcy&#x2019;s presence she dared not mention Wickham&#x2019;s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment&#x2019;s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy&#x2019;s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy&#x2019;s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley&#x2019;s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.&#013;&#013;Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth&#x2019;s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother&#x2019;s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,&#x201d; she cried; &#x201c;I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;For my own part,&#x201d; she rejoined, &#x201c;I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character&#x2014;there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, &#x2018;She a beauty!&#x2014;I should as soon call her mother a wit.&#x2019; But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, &#x201c;but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit&#x2014;of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece&#x2019;s beginning the subject.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 46&#013;Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.&#013;&#013;They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you&#x2014;be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia&#x2019;s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success&#x2014;no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia&#x2019;s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle&#x2019;s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! where, where is my uncle?&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia&#x2019;s situation, hastily exclaimed, &#x201c;I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good God! what is the matter?&#x201d; cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, &#x201c;I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.&#013;&#013;On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, &#x201c;Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I thank you,&#x201d; she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. &#x201c;There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. &#x201c;I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends&#x2014;has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of&#x2014;of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to&#x2014;she is lost for ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy was fixed in astonishment. &#x201c;When I consider,&#x201d; she added in a yet more agitated voice, &#x201c;that I might have prevented it! I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only&#x2014;some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all&#x2014;all too late now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am grieved indeed,&#x201d; cried Darcy; &#x201c;grieved&#x2014;shocked. But is it certain&#x2014;absolutely certain?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle&#x2019;s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done&#x2014;I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When my eyes were opened to his real character&#x2014;Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not&#x2014;I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.&#013;&#013;But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia&#x2014;the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, &#x201c;I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister&#x2019;s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.&#013;&#013;As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.&#013;&#013;If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth&#x2019;s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise&#x2014;if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia&#x2019;s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane&#x2019;s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham&#x2019;s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise&#x2014;all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.&#013;&#013;She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl&#x2014;oh! how acutely did she now feel it!&#013;&#013;She was wild to be at home&#x2014;to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle&#x2019;s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant&#x2019;s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.&#x2014; Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. &#x201c;But what is to be done about Pemberley?&#x201d; cried Mrs. Gardiner. &#x201c;John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is all settled?&#x201d; repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. &#x201c;And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 47&#013;&#x201c;I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,&#x201d; said her uncle, as they drove from the town; &#x201c;and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel&#x2019;s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you really think so?&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Upon my word,&#x201d; said Mrs. Gardiner, &#x201c;I begin to be of your uncle&#x2019;s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In the first place,&#x201d; replied Mr. Gardiner, &#x201c;there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then&#x2014;supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no&#x2014;this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane&#x2019;s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia&#x2014;what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father&#x2019;s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, &#x201c;that a sister&#x2019;s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth&#x2014;she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater&#x2014;what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you see that Jane,&#x201d; said her aunt, &#x201c;does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And do you really know all this?&#x201d; cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do indeed,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, colouring. &#x201c;I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty&#x2014;which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes!&#x2014;that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight&#x2019;s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth&#x2019;s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.&#013;&#013;They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.&#013;&#013;The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother&#x2019;s apartment, immediately met her.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; replied Jane. &#x201c;But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is my father in town?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And have you heard from him often?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And my mother&#x2014;how is she? How are you all?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you&#x2014;how are you?&#x201d; cried Elizabeth. &#x201c;You look pale. How much you must have gone through!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.&#013;&#013;When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes&#x2019; conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If I had been able,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here&#x2019;s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do not give way to useless alarm,&#x201d; added he; &#x201c;though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! my dear brother,&#x201d; replied Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits&#x2014;and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me&#x2014;such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.&#013;&#013;Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.&#013;&#013;In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, &#x201c;Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.&#013;&#013;In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, &#x201c;But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia&#x2019;s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying&#x2014;and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy&#x2014;a little fearful of my sister&#x2019;s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia&#x2019;s last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But not before they went to Brighton?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I believe not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps it would have been better,&#x201d; replied her sister. &#x201c;But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia&#x2019;s note to his wife?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He brought it with him for us to see.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Harriet,&#013;&#x201c;You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name &#x2018;Lydia Wickham.&#x2019; What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your affectionate friend,&#013;&#x201c;LYDIA BENNET.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. &#x201c;What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! Jane,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, &#x201c;was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters&#x2019;, if they should be of use to us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She had better have stayed at home,&#x201d; cried Elizabeth; &#x201c;perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one&#x2019;s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He meant I believe,&#x201d; replied Jane, &#x201c;to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady&#x2019;s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 48&#013;The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.&#013;&#013;When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband&#x2019;s not being killed in a duel.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up&#x2014;though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham&#x2019;s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.&#013;&#013;All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman&#x2019;s family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister&#x2019;s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.&#013;&#013;Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man&#x2019;s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.&#013;&#013;Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning&#x2019;s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.&#013;&#013;But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Sir,&#013;&#x201c;I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune&#x2014;or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent&#x2019;s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am, dear sir, etc., etc.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia&#x2019;s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. &#x201c;A gamester!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law&#x2019;s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.&#013;&#013;The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia&#x2019;s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.&#013;&#013;When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.&#013;&#013;It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, &#x201c;Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must not be too severe upon yourself,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you suppose them to be in London?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And Lydia used to want to go to London,&#x201d; added Kitty.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is happy then,&#x201d; said her father drily; &#x201c;and her residence there will probably be of some duration.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then after a short silence he continued:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother&#x2019;s tea.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is a parade,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am not going to run away, papa,&#x201d; said Kitty fretfully. &#x201c;If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 49&#013;Two days after Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, &#x201c;I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear madam,&#x201d; cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you are looking for my master, ma&#x2019;am, he is walking towards the little copse.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.&#013;&#013;Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, papa, what news&#x2014;what news? Have you heard from my uncle?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes I have had a letter from him by express.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, and what news does it bring&#x2014;good or bad?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is there of good to be expected?&#x201d; said he, taking the letter from his pocket. &#x201c;But perhaps you would like to read it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Read it aloud,&#x201d; said their father, &#x201c;for I hardly know myself what it is about.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Brother,&#013;&#x201c;At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;    &#x201c;Then it is as I always hoped,&#x201d; cried Jane; &#x201c;they are married!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth read on:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;EDW. GARDINER.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is it possible?&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. &#x201c;Can it be possible that he will marry her?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,&#x201d; said her sister. &#x201c;My dear father, I congratulate you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And have you answered the letter?&#x201d; cried Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No; but it must be done soon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! my dear father,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let me write for you,&#x201d; said Jane, &#x201c;if you dislike the trouble yourself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I dislike it very much,&#x201d; he replied; &#x201c;but it must be done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And may I ask&#x2014;&#x201d; said Elizabeth; &#x201c;but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Money! My uncle!&#x201d; cried Jane, &#x201c;what do you mean, sir?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is very true,&#x201d; said Elizabeth; &#x201c;though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle&#x2019;s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said her father; &#x201c;Wickham&#x2019;s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And they are really to be married!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. &#x201c;How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I comfort myself with thinking,&#x201d; replied Jane, &#x201c;that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If he were ever able to learn what Wickham&#x2019;s debts have been,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,&#x201d; said Jane: &#x201c;I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Their conduct has been such,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Just as you please.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May we take my uncle&#x2019;s letter to read to her?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Take whatever you like, and get away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner&#x2019;s hope of Lydia&#x2019;s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear, dear Lydia!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner&#x2019;s behaviour laid them all under.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;For we must attribute this happy conclusion,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; cried her mother, &#x201c;it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can&#x2019;t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day&#x2019;s delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will go to Meryton,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.&#013;&#013;Poor Lydia&#x2019;s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 50&#013;Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.&#013;&#013;He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.&#013;&#013;When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia&#x2019;s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband&#x2019;s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.&#013;&#013;Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother&#x2019;s hands, Lydia&#x2019;s expenses had been very little within that sum.&#013;&#013;That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.&#013;&#013;The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.&#013;&#013;It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Haye Park might do,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;if the Gouldings could quit it&#x2014;or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: &#x201c;Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter&#x2019;s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.&#013;&#013;She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister&#x2019;s frailty would have mortified her so much&#x2014;not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia&#x2019;s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.&#013;&#013;From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.&#013;&#013;What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.&#013;&#013;She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.&#013;&#013;But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.&#013;&#013;How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.&#013;&#013;Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was greatly my wish that he should do so,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece&#x2019;s. It is Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.&#x2014;Yours, etc.,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;E. GARDINER.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham&#x2019;s removal from the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia&#x2019;s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s regiment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;His daughter&#x2019;s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister&#x2019;s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 51&#013;Their sister&#x2019;s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at &#x2014;&#x2014;, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.&#013;&#013;They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.&#013;&#013;Lydia&#x2019;s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.&#013;&#013;Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.&#013;&#013;Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.&#013;&#013;There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Only think of its being three months,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, &#x201c;Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother&#x2019;s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, &#x201c;Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called &#x201c;Mrs. Wickham&#x201d; by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, mamma,&#x201d; said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, &#x201c;and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don&#x2019;t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, lord! yes;&#x2014;there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should like it beyond anything!&#x201d; said her mother.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I thank you for my share of the favour,&#x201d; said Elizabeth; &#x201c;but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.&#013;&#013;No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.&#013;&#013;Wickham&#x2019;s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia&#x2019;s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.&#013;&#013;Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.&#013;&#013;One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No really,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth; &#x201c;I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement&#x2019;s, because Wickham&#x2019;s lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o&#x2019;clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you&#x2019;ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes&#x2019; time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy!&#x201d; repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes!&#x2014;he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If it was to be secret,&#x201d; said Jane, &#x201c;say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! certainly,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; &#x201c;we will ask you no questions.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Lydia, &#x201c;for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.&#013;&#013;But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister&#x2019;s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may readily comprehend,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it&#x2014;unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not that I shall, though,&#x201d; she added to herself, as she finished the letter; &#x201c;and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane&#x2019;s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;&#x2014;till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 52&#013;Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Gracechurch Street, Sept. 6.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Niece,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don&#x2019;t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am&#x2014;and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham&#x2019;s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in &#x2014;&#x2014; street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia&#x2019;s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Everything being settled between them, Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham&#x2019;s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody&#x2019;s reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane&#x2019;s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;&#x2014;he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yours, very sincerely,&#013;&#x201c;M. GARDINER.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister&#x2019;s match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her&#x2014;for a woman who had already refused him&#x2014;as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt&#x2019;s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.&#013;&#013;She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one&#x2019;s approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?&#x201d; said he, as he joined her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You certainly do,&#x201d; she replied with a smile; &#x201c;but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;True. Are the others coming out?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She replied in the affirmative.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, she did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what did she say?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had&#x2014;not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,&#x201d; said Elizabeth. &#x201c;It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes; he introduced us to his sister.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And do you like her?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very much.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you go by the village of Kympton?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not recollect that we did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!&#x2014;Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How should you have liked making sermons?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;&#x2014;but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister&#x2019;s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 53&#013;Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.&#013;&#013;The day of his and Lydia&#x2019;s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! my dear Lydia,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;when shall we meet again?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, lord! I don&#x2019;t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Write to me very often, my dear.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Wickham&#x2019;s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife&#x2019;s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is as fine a fellow,&#x201d; said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, &#x201c;as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I often think,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;that there is nothing so bad as parting with one&#x2019;s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,&#x201d; said Elizabeth. &#x201c;It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband&#x2019;s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,&#x201d; (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). &#x201c;Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may depend on it,&#x201d; replied the other, &#x201c;for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher&#x2019;s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don&#x2019;t imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people&#x2019;s remarks.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend&#x2019;s permission, or being bold enough to come without it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yet it is hard,&#x201d; she sometimes thought, &#x201c;that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.&#013;&#013;The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;you will wait on him of course.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool&#x2019;s errand again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis an etiquette I despise,&#x201d; said he. &#x201c;If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan&#x2019;t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband&#x2019;s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew near,&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,&#x201d; said Jane to her sister. &#x201c;It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish I could say anything to comfort you,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth; &#x201c;but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.&#013;&#013;Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window&#x2014;she looked,&#x2014;she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is a gentleman with him, mamma,&#x201d; said Kitty; &#x201c;who can it be?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;La!&#x201d; replied Kitty, &#x201c;it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what&#x2019;s-his-name. That tall, proud man.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!&#x2014;and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming&#x2014;at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.&#013;&#013;The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let me first see how he behaves,&#x201d; said she; &#x201c;it will then be early enough for expectation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen&#x2019;s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother&#x2019;s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.&#013;&#013;Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.&#013;&#013;Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Could I expect it to be otherwise!&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;Yet why did he come?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.&#013;&#013;She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet.&#013;&#013;He readily agreed to it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, &#x2018;Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,&#x2019; without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner&#x2019;s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,&#x201d; continued her mother, &#x201c;but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the &#x2014;&#x2014;shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,&#x201d; said her mother, &#x201c;I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The first wish of my heart,&#x201d; said she to herself, &#x201c;is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.&#013;&#013;When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 54&#013;As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s behaviour astonished and vexed her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;did he come at all?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, very indifferent indeed,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, laughingly. &#x201c;Oh, Jane, take care.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour&#x2019;s visit, had revived.&#013;&#013;On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.&#013;&#013;His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane&#x2019;s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother&#x2019;s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.&#013;&#013;She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If he does not come to me, then,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I shall give him up for ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen&#x2019;s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The men shan&#x2019;t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is your sister at Pemberley still?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady&#x2019;s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.&#013;&#013;When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother&#x2019;s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well girls,&#x201d; said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, &#x201c;What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn&#x2014;and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases&#x2019; last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? &#x2018;Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.&#x2019; She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived&#x2014;and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley&#x2019;s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It has been a very agreeable day,&#x201d; said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. &#x201c;The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth smiled.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are very cruel,&#x201d; said her sister, &#x201c;you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How hard it is in some cases to be believed!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And how impossible in others!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 55&#013;A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Next time you call,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;I hope we shall be more lucky.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can you come to-morrow?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.&#013;&#013;He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter&#x2019;s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come&#x2014;Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy&#x2019;s hair.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We will be down as soon as we can,&#x201d; said Jane; &#x201c;but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.&#013;&#013;The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, &#x201c;What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.&#x201d; She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, &#x201c;Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,&#x201d; took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was forced to go.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We may as well leave them by themselves you know;&#x201d; said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. &#x201c;Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.&#013;&#013;He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.&#013;&#013;After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman&#x2019;s concurrence.&#013;&#013;Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother&#x2019;s schemes.&#013;&#013;But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.&#013;&#013;Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis too much!&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must go instantly to my mother;&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And this,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;is the end of all his friend&#x2019;s anxious circumspection! of all his sister&#x2019;s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where is your sister?&#x201d; said he hastily, as he opened the door.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane&#x2019;s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.&#013;&#013;It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet&#x2019;s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.&#013;&#013;Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are a good girl;&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,&#x201d; cried his wife, &#x201c;what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.&#x201d; Then addressing her daughter, &#x201c;Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan&#x2019;t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.&#013;&#013;Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.&#013;&#013;Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He has made me so happy,&#x201d; said she, one evening, &#x201c;by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I suspected as much,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth. &#x201c;But how did he account for it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It must have been his sister&#x2019;s doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is the most unforgiving speech,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley&#x2019;s pretended regard.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!&#x201d; cried Jane. &#x201c;Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.&#013;&#013;The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 56&#013;One morning, about a week after Bingley&#x2019;s engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&#013;&#013;They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.&#013;&#013;She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth&#x2019;s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship&#x2019;s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And that I suppose is one of your sisters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, madam,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. &#x201c;She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have a very small park here,&#x201d; returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas&#x2019;s.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Go, my dear,&#x201d; cried her mother, &#x201c;and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.&#013;&#013;Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How could I ever think her like her nephew?&#x201d; said she, as she looked in her face.&#013;&#013;As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bennet,&#x201d; replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, &#x201c;you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you believed it impossible to be true,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, &#x201c;I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,&#x201d; said Elizabeth coolly, &#x201c;will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never heard that it was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;These are heavy misfortunes,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth. &#x201c;But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person&#x2019;s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That will make your ladyship&#x2019;s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father&#x2019;s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient&#x2014;though untitled&#x2014;families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman&#x2019;s daughter; so far we are equal.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;True. You are a gentleman&#x2019;s daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Whatever my connections may be,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment&#x2019;s deliberation:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine seemed pleased.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will make no promise of the kind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister&#x2019;s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man&#x2019;s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew&#x2019;s sister? Is her husband, who is the son of his late father&#x2019;s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!&#x2014;of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You can now have nothing further to say,&#x201d; she resentfully answered. &#x201c;You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are then resolved to have him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,&#x201d; replied Elizabeth, &#x201c;have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment&#x2019;s concern&#x2014;and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, &#x201c;I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She did not choose it,&#x201d; said her daughter, &#x201c;she would go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 57&#013;The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.&#013;&#013;In revolving Lady Catherine&#x2019;s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.&#013;&#013;If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.&#013;&#013;The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;I was going to look for you; come into my room.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.&#013;&#013;She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The colour now rushed into Elizabeth&#x2019;s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: &#x2018;Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.&#x2019;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? &#x2018;This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,&#x2014;splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman&#x2019;s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.&#x2019;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2018;My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.&#x2019;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth tried to join in her father&#x2019;s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you not diverted?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! yes. Pray read on.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2018;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&#x2019; Mr. Collins moreover adds, &#x2018;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia&#x2019;s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.&#x2019; That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte&#x2019;s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; cried Elizabeth, &#x201c;I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins&#x2019;s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 58&#013;Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine&#x2019;s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.&#013;&#013;They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,&#x201d; replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, &#x201c;that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must not blame my aunt. Lydia&#x2019;s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you will thank me,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, &#x201c;You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.&#013;&#013;They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship&#x2019;s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It taught me to hope,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, &#x201c;Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,&#x201d; said Elizabeth. &#x201c;The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: &#x2018;had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.&#x2019; Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;&#x2014;though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Darcy mentioned his letter. &#x201c;Did it,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I knew,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When I wrote that letter,&#x201d; replied Darcy, &#x201c;I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My object then,&#x201d; replied Darcy, &#x201c;was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He then told her of Georgiana&#x2019;s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.&#013;&#013;She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.&#013;&#013;After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!&#x201d; was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must ask whether you were surprised?&#x201d; said Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.&#x201d; And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;On the evening before my going to London,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you speak from your own observation,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister&#x2019;s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 59&#013;&#x201c;My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?&#x201d; was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.&#013;&#013;The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.&#013;&#013;At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet&#x2019;s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!&#x2014;engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Jane looked at her doubtingly. &#x201c;Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,&#x201d; cried Jane. &#x201c;My dear, dear Lizzy, I would&#x2014;I do congratulate you&#x2014;but are you certain? forgive the question&#x2014;are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now I am quite happy,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley&#x2019;s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia&#x2019;s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good gracious!&#x201d; cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, &#x201c;if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley&#x2019;s way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.&#013;&#013;As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, &#x201c;Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bennet, &#x201c;to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It may do very well for the others,&#x201d; replied Mr. Bingley; &#x201c;but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won&#x2019;t it, Kitty?&#x201d; Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane&#x2019;s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother&#x2019;s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.&#013;&#013;In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father&#x2019;s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means&#x2014;that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her&#x2014;was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, &#x201c;Go to your father, he wants you in the library.&#x201d; She was gone directly.&#013;&#013;Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. &#x201c;Lizzy,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have you any other objection,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, &#x201c;than your belief of my indifference?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do, I do like him,&#x201d; she replied, with tears in her eyes, &#x201c;I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lizzy,&#x201d; said her father, &#x201c;I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months&#x2019; suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father&#x2019;s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, my dear,&#x201d; said he, when she ceased speaking, &#x201c;I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow&#x2019;s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle&#x2019;s doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins&#x2019;s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go&#x2014;saying, as she quitted the room, &#x201c;If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour&#x2019;s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.&#013;&#013;When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane&#x2019;s is nothing to it&#x2014;nothing at all. I am so pleased&#x2014;so happy. Such a charming man!&#x2014;so handsome! so tall!&#x2014;Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dearest child,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! &#x2019;Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was a sad omen of what her mother&#x2019;s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations&#x2019; consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.&#013;&#013;Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,&#x201d; said he. &#x201c;Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane&#x2019;s.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 60&#013;Elizabeth&#x2019;s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. &#x201c;How could you begin?&#x201d; said she. &#x201c;I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners&#x2014;my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;For the liveliness of your mind, I did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There&#x2014;I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me&#x2014;but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I was embarrassed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And so was I.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A man who had felt less, might.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine&#x2019;s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt&#x2019;s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner&#x2019;s long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear Sir,&#013;&#x201c;I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yours sincerely, etc.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley&#x2019;s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.&#013;&#013;The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother&#x2019;s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.&#013;&#013;Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew&#x2019;s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James&#x2019;s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Phillips&#x2019;s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley&#x2019;s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 61&#013;Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.&#013;&#013;Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.&#013;&#013;Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia&#x2019;s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia&#x2019;s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.&#013;&#013;Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters&#x2019; beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.&#013;&#013;As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dear Lizzy,&#013;&#x201c;I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yours, etc.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.&#013;&#013;Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth&#x2019;s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley&#x2019;s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.&#013;&#013;Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy&#x2019;s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.&#013;&#013;Pemberley was now Georgiana&#x2019;s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth&#x2019;s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.&#013;&#013;Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth&#x2019;s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.&#013;&#013;With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.&#013;",

I shall be late!&#x201d; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&#013;&#013;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.&#013;&#013;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.&#013;&#013;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &#x201c;ORANGE MARMALADE&#x201d;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well!&#x201d; thought Alice to herself, &#x201c;after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&#x2019;ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn&#x2019;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!&#x201d; (Which was very likely true.)&#013;&#013;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? &#x201c;I wonder how many miles I&#x2019;ve fallen by this time?&#x201d; she said aloud. &#x201c;I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think&#x2014;&#x201d; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) &#x201c;&#x2014;yes, that&#x2019;s about the right distance&#x2014;but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&#x2019;ve got to?&#x201d; (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)&#013;&#013;Presently she began again. &#x201c;I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it&#x2019;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think&#x2014;&#x201d; (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn&#x2019;t sound at all the right word) &#x201c;&#x2014;but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma&#x2019;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&#x201d; (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke&#x2014;fancy curtseying as you&#x2019;re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &#x201c;And what an ignorant little girl she&#x2019;ll think me for asking! No, it&#x2019;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &#x201c;Dinah&#x2019;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&#x201d; (Dinah was the cat.) &#x201c;I hope they&#x2019;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I&#x2019;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&#x2019;s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&#x201d; And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, &#x201c;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&#x201d; and sometimes, &#x201c;Do bats eat cats?&#x201d; for, you see, as she couldn&#x2019;t answer either question, it didn&#x2019;t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &#x201c;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&#x201d; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.&#013;&#013;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &#x201c;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&#x2019;s getting!&#x201d; She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.&#013;&#013;There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.&#013;&#013;Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&#x2019;s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!&#013;&#013;Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &#x201c;and even if my head would go through,&#x201d; thought poor Alice, &#x201c;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&#x201d; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.&#013;&#013;There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (&#x201c;which certainly was not here before,&#x201d; said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &#x201c;DRINK ME,&#x201d; beautifully printed on it in large letters.&#013;&#013;It was all very well to say &#x201c;Drink me,&#x201d; but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll look first,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and see whether it&#x2019;s marked &#x2018;poison&#x2019; or not&#x201d;; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &#x201c;poison,&#x201d; it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.&#013;&#013;However, this bottle was not marked &#x201c;poison,&#x201d; so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.&#013;&#013;*      *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#013;    *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#013;*      *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#x201c;What a curious feeling!&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;I must be shutting up like a telescope.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; &#x201c;for it might end, you know,&#x201d; said Alice to herself, &#x201c;in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?&#x201d; And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.&#013;&#013;After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come, there&#x2019;s no use in crying like that!&#x201d; said Alice to herself, rather sharply; &#x201c;I advise you to leave off this minute!&#x201d; She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s no use now,&#x201d; thought poor Alice, &#x201c;to pretend to be two people! Why, there&#x2019;s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words &#x201c;EAT ME&#x201d; were beautifully marked in currants. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll eat it,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I&#x2019;ll get into the garden, and I don&#x2019;t care which happens!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &#x201c;Which way? Which way?&#x201d;, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.&#013;&#013;So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.&#013;&#013;*      *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#013;    *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#013;*      *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;CHAPTER II.&#013;The Pool of Tears&#013;&#x201c;Curiouser and curiouser!&#x201d; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); &#x201c;now I&#x2019;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!&#x201d; (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). &#x201c;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I&#x2019;m sure I shan&#x2019;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;&#x2014;but I must be kind to them,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;or perhaps they won&#x2019;t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I&#x2019;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. &#x201c;They must go by the carrier,&#x201d; she thought; &#x201c;and how funny it&#x2019;ll seem, sending presents to one&#x2019;s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!&#013;&#013;     Alice&#x2019;s Right Foot, Esq.,&#013;       Hearthrug,&#013;         near the Fender,&#013;           (with Alice&#x2019;s love).&#013;Oh dear, what nonsense I&#x2019;m talking!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.&#013;&#013;Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;a great girl like you,&#x201d; (she might well say this), &#x201c;to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!&#x201d; But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.&#013;&#013;After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, &#x201c;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won&#x2019;t she be savage if I&#x2019;ve kept her waiting!&#x201d; Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, &#x201c;If you please, sir&#x2014;&#x201d; The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.&#013;&#013;Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: &#x201c;Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I&#x2019;ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I&#x2019;m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that&#x2019;s the great puzzle!&#x201d; And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m not Ada,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn&#x2019;t go in ringlets at all; and I&#x2019;m sure I can&#x2019;t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she&#x2019;s she, and I&#x2019;m I, and&#x2014;oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I&#x2019;ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is&#x2014;oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn&#x2019;t signify: let&#x2019;s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome&#x2014;no, that&#x2019;s all wrong, I&#x2019;m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I&#x2019;ll try and say &#x2018;How doth the little&#x2014;&#x2019;&#x201d; and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How doth the little crocodile&#013;    Improve his shining tail,&#013;And pour the waters of the Nile&#013;    On every golden scale!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How cheerfully he seems to grin,&#013;    How neatly spread his claws,&#013;And welcome little fishes in&#013;    With gently smiling jaws!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure those are not the right words,&#x201d; said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, &#x201c;I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I&#x2019;ve made up my mind about it; if I&#x2019;m Mabel, I&#x2019;ll stay down here! It&#x2019;ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying &#x2018;Come up again, dear!&#x2019; I shall only look up and say &#x2018;Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I&#x2019;ll come up: if not, I&#x2019;ll stay down here till I&#x2019;m somebody else&#x2019;&#x2014;but, oh dear!&#x201d; cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, &#x201c;I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit&#x2019;s little white kid gloves while she was talking. &#x201c;How can I have done that?&#x201d; she thought. &#x201c;I must be growing small again.&#x201d; She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That was a narrow escape!&#x201d; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; &#x201c;and now for the garden!&#x201d; and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, &#x201c;and things are worse than ever,&#x201d; thought the poor child, &#x201c;for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it&#x2019;s too bad, that it is!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, &#x201c;and in that case I can go back by railway,&#x201d; she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish I hadn&#x2019;t cried so much!&#x201d; said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. &#x201c;I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Would it be of any use, now,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there&#x2019;s no harm in trying.&#x201d; So she began: &#x201c;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!&#x201d; (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother&#x2019;s Latin Grammar, &#x201c;A mouse&#x2014;of a mouse&#x2014;to a mouse&#x2014;a mouse&#x2014;O mouse!&#x201d;) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps it doesn&#x2019;t understand English,&#x201d; thought Alice; &#x201c;I daresay it&#x2019;s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.&#x201d; (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: &#x201c;O&ugrave; est ma chatte?&#x201d; which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. &#x201c;Oh, I beg your pardon!&#x201d; cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal&#x2019;s feelings. &#x201c;I quite forgot you didn&#x2019;t like cats.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not like cats!&#x201d; cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. &#x201c;Would you like cats if you were me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, perhaps not,&#x201d; said Alice in a soothing tone: &#x201c;don&#x2019;t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you&#x2019;d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,&#x201d; Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, &#x201c;and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face&#x2014;and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s such a capital one for catching mice&#x2014;oh, I beg your pardon!&#x201d; cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t talk about her any more if you&#x2019;d rather not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We indeed!&#x201d; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. &#x201c;As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&#x2019;t let me hear the name again!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t indeed!&#x201d; said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. &#x201c;Are you&#x2014;are you fond&#x2014;of&#x2014;of dogs?&#x201d; The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: &#x201c;There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it&#x2019;ll fetch things when you throw them, and it&#x2019;ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t remember half of them&#x2014;and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it&#x2019;s so useful, it&#x2019;s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and&#x2014;oh dear!&#x201d; cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ve offended it again!&#x201d; For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.&#013;&#013;So she called softly after it, &#x201c;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won&#x2019;t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don&#x2019;t like them!&#x201d; When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, &#x201c;Let us get to the shore, and then I&#x2019;ll tell you my history, and you&#x2019;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.&#013;&#013;CHAPTER III.&#013;A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale&#013;They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank&#x2014;the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.&#013;&#013;The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, &#x201c;I am older than you, and must know better;&#x201d; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.&#013;&#013;At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, &#x201c;Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I&#x2019;ll soon make you dry enough!&#x201d; They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ahem!&#x201d; said the Mouse with an important air, &#x201c;are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! &#x2018;William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria&#x2014;&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ugh!&#x201d; said the Lory, with a shiver.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I beg your pardon!&#x201d; said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: &#x201c;Did you speak?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not I!&#x201d; said the Lory hastily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I thought you did,&#x201d; said the Mouse. &#x201c;&#x2014;I proceed. &#x2018;Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable&#x2014;&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Found what?&#x201d; said the Duck.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Found it,&#x201d; the Mouse replied rather crossly: &#x201c;of course you know what &#x2018;it&#x2019; means.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know what &#x2018;it&#x2019; means well enough, when I find a thing,&#x201d; said the Duck: &#x201c;it&#x2019;s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, &#x201c;&#x2018;&#x2014;found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William&#x2019;s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans&#x2014;&#x2019; How are you getting on now, my dear?&#x201d; it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As wet as ever,&#x201d; said Alice in a melancholy tone: &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t seem to dry me at all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In that case,&#x201d; said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, &#x201c;I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Speak English!&#x201d; said the Eaglet. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what&#x2019;s more, I don&#x2019;t believe you do either!&#x201d; And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What I was going to say,&#x201d; said the Dodo in an offended tone, &#x201c;was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is a Caucus-race?&#x201d; said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why,&#x201d; said the Dodo, &#x201c;the best way to explain it is to do it.&#x201d; (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)&#013;&#013;First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (&#x201c;the exact shape doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no &#x201c;One, two, three, and away,&#x201d; but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out &#x201c;The race is over!&#x201d; and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, &#x201c;But who has won?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, &#x201c;Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But who is to give the prizes?&#x201d; quite a chorus of voices asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, she, of course,&#x201d; said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, &#x201c;Prizes! Prizes!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But she must have a prize herself, you know,&#x201d; said the Mouse.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; the Dodo replied very gravely. &#x201c;What else have you got in your pocket?&#x201d; he went on, turning to Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Only a thimble,&#x201d; said Alice sadly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hand it over here,&#x201d; said the Dodo.&#013;&#013;Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying &#x201c;We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;&#x201d; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.&#013;&#013;Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.&#013;&#013;The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You promised to tell me your history, you know,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;and why it is you hate&#x2014;C and D,&#x201d; she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mine is a long and a sad tale!&#x201d; said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a long tail, certainly,&#x201d; said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse&#x2019;s tail; &#x201c;but why do you call it sad?&#x201d; And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;         &#x201c;Fury said to a&#013;         mouse, That he&#013;        met in the&#013;       house,&#013;     &#x2018;Let us&#013;      both go to&#013;       law: I will&#013;        prosecute&#013;         you.&#x2014;Come,&#013;           I&#x2019;ll take no&#013;           denial; We&#013;          must have a&#013;        trial: For&#013;      really this&#013;     morning I&#x2019;ve&#013;    nothing&#013;    to do.&#x2019;&#013;      Said the&#013;      mouse to the&#013;       cur, &#x2018;Such&#013;        a trial,&#013;         dear sir,&#013;            With&#013;          no jury&#013;        or judge,&#013;       would be&#013;      wasting&#013;      our&#013;      breath.&#x2019;&#013;        &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be&#013;        judge, I&#x2019;ll&#013;         be jury,&#x2019;&#013;             Said&#013;         cunning&#013;          old Fury:&#013;          &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll&#013;          try the&#013;            whole&#013;            cause,&#013;              and&#013;           condemn&#013;           you&#013;          to&#013;           death.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#x201c;You are not attending!&#x201d; said the Mouse to Alice severely. &#x201c;What are you thinking of?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I beg your pardon,&#x201d; said Alice very humbly: &#x201c;you had got to the fifth bend, I think?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had not!&#x201d; cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A knot!&#x201d; said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. &#x201c;Oh, do let me help to undo it!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall do nothing of the sort,&#x201d; said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. &#x201c;You insult me by talking such nonsense!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it!&#x201d; pleaded poor Alice. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re so easily offended, you know!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Mouse only growled in reply.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Please come back and finish your story!&#x201d; Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, &#x201c;Yes, please do!&#x201d; but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What a pity it wouldn&#x2019;t stay!&#x201d; sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter &#x201c;Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!&#x201d; &#x201c;Hold your tongue, Ma!&#x201d; said the young Crab, a little snappishly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re enough to try the patience of an oyster!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!&#x201d; said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d soon fetch it back!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?&#x201d; said the Lory.&#013;&#013;Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: &#x201c;Dinah&#x2019;s our cat. And she&#x2019;s such a capital one for catching mice you can&#x2019;t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she&#x2019;ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, &#x201c;I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn&#x2019;t suit my throat!&#x201d; and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, &#x201c;Come away, my dears! It&#x2019;s high time you were all in bed!&#x201d; On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned Dinah!&#x201d; she said to herself in a melancholy tone. &#x201c;Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!&#x201d; And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.&#013;&#013;CHAPTER IV.&#013;The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill&#013;It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself &#x201c;The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She&#x2019;ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?&#x201d; Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen&#x2014;everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.&#013;&#013;Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, &#x201c;Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!&#x201d; And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He took me for his housemaid,&#x201d; she said to herself as she ran. &#x201c;How surprised he&#x2019;ll be when he finds out who I am! But I&#x2019;d better take him his fan and gloves&#x2014;that is, if I can find them.&#x201d; As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name &#x201c;W. RABBIT,&#x201d; engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How queer it seems,&#x201d; Alice said to herself, &#x201c;to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah&#x2019;ll be sending me on messages next!&#x201d; And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: &#x201c;&#x2018;Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!&#x2019; &#x2018;Coming in a minute, nurse! But I&#x2019;ve got to see that the mouse doesn&#x2019;t get out.&#x2019; Only I don&#x2019;t think,&#x201d; Alice went on, &#x201c;that they&#x2019;d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words &#x201c;DRINK ME,&#x201d; but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. &#x201c;I know something interesting is sure to happen,&#x201d; she said to herself, &#x201c;whenever I eat or drink anything; so I&#x2019;ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it&#x2019;ll make me grow large again, for really I&#x2019;m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself &#x201c;That&#x2019;s quite enough&#x2014;I hope I shan&#x2019;t grow any more&#x2014;As it is, I can&#x2019;t get out at the door&#x2014;I do wish I hadn&#x2019;t drunk quite so much!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself &#x201c;Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was much pleasanter at home,&#x201d; thought poor Alice, &#x201c;when one wasn&#x2019;t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn&#x2019;t gone down that rabbit-hole&#x2014;and yet&#x2014;and yet&#x2014;it&#x2019;s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I&#x2019;ll write one&#x2014;but I&#x2019;m grown up now,&#x201d; she added in a sorrowful tone; &#x201c;at least there&#x2019;s no room to grow up any more here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But then,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;shall I never get any older than I am now? That&#x2019;ll be a comfort, one way&#x2014;never to be an old woman&#x2014;but then&#x2014;always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn&#x2019;t like that!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, you foolish Alice!&#x201d; she answered herself. &#x201c;How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there&#x2019;s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mary Ann! Mary Ann!&#x201d; said the voice. &#x201c;Fetch me my gloves this moment!&#x201d; Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.&#013;&#013;Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice&#x2019;s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll go round and get in at the window.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That you won&#x2019;t!&#x201d; thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.&#013;&#013;Next came an angry voice&#x2014;the Rabbit&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201c;Pat! Pat! Where are you?&#x201d; And then a voice she had never heard before, &#x201c;Sure then I&#x2019;m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Digging for apples, indeed!&#x201d; said the Rabbit angrily. &#x201c;Here! Come and help me out of this!&#x201d; (Sounds of more broken glass.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now tell me, Pat, what&#x2019;s that in the window?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sure, it&#x2019;s an arm, yer honour!&#x201d; (He pronounced it &#x201c;arrum.&#x201d;)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sure, it does, yer honour: but it&#x2019;s an arm for all that.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, &#x201c;Sure, I don&#x2019;t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!&#x201d; &#x201c;Do as I tell you, you coward!&#x201d; and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. &#x201c;What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!&#x201d; thought Alice. &#x201c;I wonder what they&#x2019;ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I&#x2019;m sure I don&#x2019;t want to stay in here any longer!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the other ladder?&#x2014;Why, I hadn&#x2019;t to bring but one; Bill&#x2019;s got the other&#x2014;Bill! fetch it here, lad!&#x2014;Here, put &#x2019;em up at this corner&#x2014;No, tie &#x2019;em together first&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t reach half high enough yet&#x2014;Oh! they&#x2019;ll do well enough; don&#x2019;t be particular&#x2014;Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope&#x2014;Will the roof bear?&#x2014;Mind that loose slate&#x2014;Oh, it&#x2019;s coming down! Heads below!&#x201d; (a loud crash)&#x2014;&#x201c;Now, who did that?&#x2014;It was Bill, I fancy&#x2014;Who&#x2019;s to go down the chimney?&#x2014;Nay, I shan&#x2019;t! You do it!&#x2014;That I won&#x2019;t, then!&#x2014;Bill&#x2019;s to go down&#x2014;Here, Bill! the master says you&#x2019;re to go down the chimney!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh! So Bill&#x2019;s got to come down the chimney, has he?&#x201d; said Alice to herself. &#x201c;Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn&#x2019;t be in Bill&#x2019;s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn&#x2019;t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself &#x201c;This is Bill,&#x201d; she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.&#013;&#013;The first thing she heard was a general chorus of &#x201c;There goes Bill!&#x201d; then the Rabbit&#x2019;s voice along&#x2014;&#x201c;Catch him, you by the hedge!&#x201d; then silence, and then another confusion of voices&#x2014;&#x201c;Hold up his head&#x2014;Brandy now&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t choke him&#x2014;How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Bill,&#x201d; thought Alice,) &#x201c;Well, I hardly know&#x2014;No more, thank ye; I&#x2019;m better now&#x2014;but I&#x2019;m a deal too flustered to tell you&#x2014;all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So you did, old fellow!&#x201d; said the others.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We must burn the house down!&#x201d; said the Rabbit&#x2019;s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, &#x201c;If you do, I&#x2019;ll set Dinah at you!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, &#x201c;I wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they&#x2019;d take the roof off.&#x201d; After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, &#x201c;A barrowful will do, to begin with.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A barrowful of what?&#x201d; thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put a stop to this,&#x201d; she said to herself, and shouted out, &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better not do that again!&#x201d; which produced another dead silence.&#013;&#013;Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. &#x201c;If I eat one of these cakes,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can&#x2019;t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The first thing I&#x2019;ve got to do,&#x201d; said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, &#x201c;is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.&#013;&#013;An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. &#x201c;Poor little thing!&#x201d; said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.&#013;&#013;Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.&#013;&#013;This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy&#x2019;s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And yet what a dear little puppy it was!&#x201d; said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: &#x201c;I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if&#x2014;if I&#x2019;d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I&#x2019;d nearly forgotten that I&#x2019;ve got to grow up again! Let me see&#x2014;how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.&#013;&#013;She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.&#013;&#013;CHAPTER V.&#013;Advice from a Caterpillar&#013;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &#x201c;I&#x2014;I hardly know, sir, just at present&#x2014;at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you mean by that?&#x201d; said the Caterpillar sternly. &#x201c;Explain yourself!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t explain myself, I&#x2019;m afraid, sir,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;because I&#x2019;m not myself, you see.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I can&#x2019;t put it more clearly,&#x201d; Alice replied very politely, &#x201c;for I can&#x2019;t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, perhaps you haven&#x2019;t found it so yet,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;but when you have to turn into a chrysalis&#x2014;you will some day, you know&#x2014;and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you&#x2019;ll feel it a little queer, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not a bit,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You!&#x201d; said the Caterpillar contemptuously. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar&#x2019;s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, &#x201c;I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come back!&#x201d; the Caterpillar called after her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve something important to say!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Keep your temper,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d; said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, &#x201c;So you think you&#x2019;re changed, do you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I am, sir,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember things as I used&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t keep the same size for ten minutes together!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t remember what things?&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ve tried to say &#x201c;How doth the little busy bee,&#x201d; but it all came different!&#x201d; Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Repeat, &#x201c;You are old, Father William,&#x2019;&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;Alice folded her hands, and began:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are old, Father William,&#x201d; the young man said,&#013;    &#x201c;And your hair has become very white;&#013;And yet you incessantly stand on your head&#x2014;&#013;    Do you think, at your age, it is right?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In my youth,&#x201d; Father William replied to his son,&#013;    &#x201c;I feared it might injure the brain;&#013;But, now that I&#x2019;m perfectly sure I have none,&#013;    Why, I do it again and again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are old,&#x201d; said the youth, &#x201c;as I mentioned before,&#013;    And have grown most uncommonly fat;&#013;Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door&#x2014;&#013;    Pray, what is the reason of that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In my youth,&#x201d; said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,&#013;    &#x201c;I kept all my limbs very supple&#013;By the use of this ointment&#x2014;one shilling the box&#x2014;&#013;    Allow me to sell you a couple?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are old,&#x201d; said the youth, &#x201c;and your jaws are too weak&#013;    For anything tougher than suet;&#013;Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak&#x2014;&#013;    Pray, how did you manage to do it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In my youth,&#x201d; said his father, &#x201c;I took to the law,&#013;    And argued each case with my wife;&#013;And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,&#013;    Has lasted the rest of my life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are old,&#x201d; said the youth, &#x201c;one would hardly suppose&#013;    That your eye was as steady as ever;&#013;Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose&#x2014;&#013;    What made you so awfully clever?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have answered three questions, and that is enough,&#x201d;&#013;    Said his father; &#x201c;don&#x2019;t give yourself airs!&#013;Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?&#013;    Be off, or I&#x2019;ll kick you down stairs!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is not said right,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not quite right, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; said Alice, timidly; &#x201c;some of the words have got altered.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is wrong from beginning to end,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.&#013;&#013;The Caterpillar was the first to speak.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What size do you want to be?&#x201d; it asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m not particular as to size,&#x201d; Alice hastily replied; &#x201c;only one doesn&#x2019;t like changing so often, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you content now?&#x201d; said the Caterpillar.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; said Alice: &#x201c;three inches is such a wretched height to be.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a very good height indeed!&#x201d; said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not used to it!&#x201d; pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, &#x201c;I wish the creatures wouldn&#x2019;t be so easily offended!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get used to it in time,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.&#013;&#013;This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, &#x201c;One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;One side of what? The other side of what?&#x201d; thought Alice to herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of the mushroom,&#x201d; said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.&#013;&#013;Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And now which is which?&#x201d; she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!&#013;&#013;She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.&#013;&#013;*      *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#013;    *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#013;*      *      *      *      *      *      *&#013;&#x201c;Come, my head&#x2019;s free at last!&#x201d; said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What can all that green stuff be?&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;And where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can&#x2019;t see you?&#x201d; She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.&#013;&#013;As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Serpent!&#x201d; screamed the Pigeon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a serpent!&#x201d; said Alice indignantly. &#x201c;Let me alone!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Serpent, I say again!&#x201d; repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the least idea what you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried the roots of trees, and I&#x2019;ve tried banks, and I&#x2019;ve tried hedges,&#x201d; the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; &#x201c;but those serpents! There&#x2019;s no pleasing them!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As if it wasn&#x2019;t trouble enough hatching the eggs,&#x201d; said the Pigeon; &#x201c;but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven&#x2019;t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry you&#x2019;ve been annoyed,&#x201d; said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And just as I&#x2019;d taken the highest tree in the wood,&#x201d; continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, &#x201c;and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not a serpent, I tell you!&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well! What are you?&#x201d; said the Pigeon. &#x201c;I can see you&#x2019;re trying to invent something!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a little girl,&#x201d; said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A likely story indeed!&#x201d; said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You&#x2019;re a serpent; and there&#x2019;s no use denying it. I suppose you&#x2019;ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have tasted eggs, certainly,&#x201d; said Alice, who was a very truthful child; &#x201c;but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; said the Pigeon; &#x201c;but if they do, why then they&#x2019;re a kind of serpent, that&#x2019;s all I can say.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you&#x2019;re a little girl or a serpent?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It matters a good deal to me,&#x201d; said Alice hastily; &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn&#x2019;t want yours: I don&#x2019;t like them raw.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, be off, then!&#x201d; said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.&#013;&#013;It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. &#x201c;Come, there&#x2019;s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I&#x2019;m never sure what I&#x2019;m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I&#x2019;ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden&#x2014;how is that to be done, I wonder?&#x201d; As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. &#x201c;Whoever lives there,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;it&#x2019;ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!&#x201d; So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.&#013;&#013;CHAPTER VI.&#013;Pig and Pepper&#013;For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood&#x2014;(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)&#x2014;and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.&#013;&#013;The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, &#x201c;For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.&#x201d; The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, &#x201c;From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.&#013;&#013;Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.&#013;&#013;Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no sort of use in knocking,&#x201d; said the Footman, &#x201c;and that for two reasons. First, because I&#x2019;m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they&#x2019;re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.&#x201d; And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within&#x2014;a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Please, then,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;how am I to get in?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There might be some sense in your knocking,&#x201d; the Footman went on without attending to her, &#x201c;if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.&#x201d; He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. &#x201c;But perhaps he can&#x2019;t help it,&#x201d; she said to herself; &#x201c;his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.&#x2014;How am I to get in?&#x201d; she repeated, aloud.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall sit here,&#x201d; the Footman remarked, &#x201c;till tomorrow&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman&#x2019;s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2014;or next day, maybe,&#x201d; the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How am I to get in?&#x201d; asked Alice again, in a louder tone.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you to get in at all?&#x201d; said the Footman. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first question, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really dreadful,&#x201d; she muttered to herself, &#x201c;the way all the creatures argue. It&#x2019;s enough to drive one crazy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. &#x201c;I shall sit here,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;on and off, for days and days.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But what am I to do?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Anything you like,&#x201d; said the Footman, and began whistling.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, there&#x2019;s no use in talking to him,&#x201d; said Alice desperately: &#x201c;he&#x2019;s perfectly idiotic!&#x201d; And she opened the door and went in.&#013;&#013;The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s certainly too much pepper in that soup!&#x201d; Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.&#013;&#013;There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment&#x2019;s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Please would you tell me,&#x201d; said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, &#x201c;why your cat grins like that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Cheshire cat,&#x201d; said the Duchess, &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s why. Pig!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn&#x2019;t know that cats could grin.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They all can,&#x201d; said the Duchess; &#x201c;and most of &#x2019;em do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know of any that do,&#x201d; Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know much,&#x201d; said the Duchess; &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s a fact.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby&#x2014;the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, please mind what you&#x2019;re doing!&#x201d; cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. &#x201c;Oh, there goes his precious nose!&#x201d; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If everybody minded their own business,&#x201d; the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, &#x201c;the world would go round a deal faster than it does.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Which would not be an advantage,&#x201d; said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. &#x201c;Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Talking of axes,&#x201d; said the Duchess, &#x201c;chop off her head!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: &#x201c;Twenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve? I&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t bother me,&#x201d; said the Duchess; &#x201c;I never could abide figures!&#x201d; And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Speak roughly to your little boy,&#013;    And beat him when he sneezes:&#013;He only does it to annoy,&#013;    Because he knows it teases.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;CHORUS.&#013;(In which the cook and the baby joined):&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wow! wow! wow!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I speak severely to my boy,&#013;    I beat him when he sneezes;&#013;For he can thoroughly enjoy&#013;    The pepper when he pleases!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;CHORUS.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wow! wow! wow!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!&#x201d; the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. &#x201c;I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,&#x201d; and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.&#013;&#013;Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, &#x201c;just like a star-fish,&#x201d; thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.&#013;&#013;As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t take this child away with me,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;they&#x2019;re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn&#x2019;t it be murder to leave it behind?&#x201d; She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t grunt,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;that&#x2019;s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. &#x201c;But perhaps it was only sobbing,&#x201d; she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.&#013;&#013;No, there were no tears. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to turn into a pig, my dear,&#x201d; said Alice, seriously, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!&#x201d; The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.&#013;&#013;Alice was just beginning to think to herself, &#x201c;Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?&#x201d; when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.&#013;&#013;So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. &#x201c;If it had grown up,&#x201d; she said to herself, &#x201c;it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.&#x201d; And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, &#x201c;if one only knew the right way to change them&#x2014;&#x201d; when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.&#013;&#013;The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Cheshire Puss,&#x201d; she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. &#x201c;Come, it&#x2019;s pleased so far,&#x201d; thought Alice, and she went on. &#x201c;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,&#x201d; said the Cat.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t much care where&#x2014;&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then it doesn&#x2019;t matter which way you go,&#x201d; said the Cat.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2014;so long as I get somewhere,&#x201d; Alice added as an explanation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re sure to do that,&#x201d; said the Cat, &#x201c;if you only walk long enough.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. &#x201c;What sort of people live about here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In that direction,&#x201d; the Cat said, waving its right paw round, &#x201c;lives a Hatter: and in that direction,&#x201d; waving the other paw, &#x201c;lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they&#x2019;re both mad.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to go among mad people,&#x201d; Alice remarked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, you can&#x2019;t help that,&#x201d; said the Cat: &#x201c;we&#x2019;re all mad here. I&#x2019;m mad. You&#x2019;re mad.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How do you know I&#x2019;m mad?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must be,&#x201d; said the Cat, &#x201c;or you wouldn&#x2019;t have come here.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice didn&#x2019;t think that proved it at all; however, she went on &#x201c;And how do you know that you&#x2019;re mad?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To begin with,&#x201d; said the Cat, &#x201c;a dog&#x2019;s not mad. You grant that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; the Cat went on, &#x201c;you see, a dog growls when it&#x2019;s angry, and wags its tail when it&#x2019;s pleased. Now I growl when I&#x2019;m pleased, and wag my tail when I&#x2019;m angry. Therefore I&#x2019;m mad.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I call it purring, not growling,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Call it what you like,&#x201d; said the Cat. &#x201c;Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should like it very much,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;but I haven&#x2019;t been invited yet.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see me there,&#x201d; said the Cat, and vanished.&#013;&#013;Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&#x201d; said the Cat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d nearly forgotten to ask.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It turned into a pig,&#x201d; Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I thought it would,&#x201d; said the Cat, and vanished again.&#013;&#013;Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen hatters before,&#x201d; she said to herself; &#x201c;the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won&#x2019;t be raving mad&#x2014;at least not so mad as it was in March.&#x201d; As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you say pig, or fig?&#x201d; said the Cat.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I said pig,&#x201d; replied Alice; &#x201c;and I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well! I&#x2019;ve often seen a cat without a grin,&#x201d; thought Alice; &#x201c;but a grin without a cat! It&#x2019;s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself &#x201c;Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I&#x2019;d gone to see the Hatter instead!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER VII.&#013;A Mad Tea-Party&#013;There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. &#x201c;Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,&#x201d; thought Alice; &#x201c;only, as it&#x2019;s asleep, I suppose it doesn&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: &#x201c;No room! No room!&#x201d; they cried out when they saw Alice coming. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty of room!&#x201d; said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have some wine,&#x201d; the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.&#013;&#013;Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any wine,&#x201d; she remarked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t any,&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then it wasn&#x2019;t very civil of you to offer it,&#x201d; said Alice angrily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it was your table,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;it&#x2019;s laid for a great many more than three.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your hair wants cutting,&#x201d; said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You should learn not to make personal remarks,&#x201d; Alice said with some severity; &#x201c;it&#x2019;s very rude.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, &#x201c;Why is a raven like a writing-desk?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come, we shall have some fun now!&#x201d; thought Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad they&#x2019;ve begun asking riddles.&#x2014;I believe I can guess that,&#x201d; she added aloud.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Exactly so,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then you should say what you mean,&#x201d; the March Hare went on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; Alice hastily replied; &#x201c;at least&#x2014;at least I mean what I say&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the same thing, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not the same thing a bit!&#x201d; said the Hatter. &#x201c;You might just as well say that &#x2018;I see what I eat&#x2019; is the same thing as &#x2018;I eat what I see&#x2019;!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You might just as well say,&#x201d; added the March Hare, &#x201c;that &#x2018;I like what I get&#x2019; is the same thing as &#x2018;I get what I like&#x2019;!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You might just as well say,&#x201d; added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, &#x201c;that &#x2018;I breathe when I sleep&#x2019; is the same thing as &#x2018;I sleep when I breathe&#x2019;!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is the same thing with you,&#x201d; said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn&#x2019;t much.&#013;&#013;The Hatter was the first to break the silence. &#x201c;What day of the month is it?&#x201d; he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.&#013;&#013;Alice considered a little, and then said &#x201c;The fourth.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Two days wrong!&#x201d; sighed the Hatter. &#x201c;I told you butter wouldn&#x2019;t suit the works!&#x201d; he added looking angrily at the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was the best butter,&#x201d; the March Hare meekly replied.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,&#x201d; the Hatter grumbled: &#x201c;you shouldn&#x2019;t have put it in with the bread-knife.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, &#x201c;It was the best butter, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. &#x201c;What a funny watch!&#x201d; she remarked. &#x201c;It tells the day of the month, and doesn&#x2019;t tell what o&#x2019;clock it is!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why should it?&#x201d; muttered the Hatter. &#x201c;Does your watch tell you what year it is?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Alice replied very readily: &#x201c;but that&#x2019;s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Which is just the case with mine,&#x201d; said the Hatter.&#013;&#013;Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter&#x2019;s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t quite understand you,&#x201d; she said, as politely as she could.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The Dormouse is asleep again,&#x201d; said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.&#013;&#013;The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, &#x201c;Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have you guessed the riddle yet?&#x201d; the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I give it up,&#x201d; Alice replied: &#x201c;what&#x2019;s the answer?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the slightest idea,&#x201d; said the Hatter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nor I,&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;Alice sighed wearily. &#x201c;I think you might do something better with the time,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you knew Time as well as I do,&#x201d; said the Hatter, &#x201c;you wouldn&#x2019;t talk about wasting it. It&#x2019;s him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you mean,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. &#x201c;I dare say you never even spoke to Time!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps not,&#x201d; Alice cautiously replied: &#x201c;but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah! that accounts for it,&#x201d; said the Hatter. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he&#x2019;d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o&#x2019;clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you&#x2019;d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;(&#x201c;I only wish it was,&#x201d; the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That would be grand, certainly,&#x201d; said Alice thoughtfully: &#x201c;but then&#x2014;I shouldn&#x2019;t be hungry for it, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not at first, perhaps,&#x201d; said the Hatter: &#x201c;but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is that the way you manage?&#x201d; Alice asked.&#013;&#013;The Hatter shook his head mournfully. &#x201c;Not I!&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;We quarrelled last March&#x2014;just before he went mad, you know&#x2014;&#x201d; (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) &#x201c;&#x2014;it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing&#013;&#013;&#x2018;Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!&#013;How I wonder what you&#x2019;re at!&#x2019;&#013;&#013;You know the song, perhaps?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard something like it,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It goes on, you know,&#x201d; the Hatter continued, &#x201c;in this way:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x2018;Up above the world you fly,&#013;Like a tea-tray in the sky.&#013;                    Twinkle, twinkle&#x2014;&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep &#x201c;Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle&#x2014;&#x201d; and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d hardly finished the first verse,&#x201d; said the Hatter, &#x201c;when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, &#x2018;He&#x2019;s murdering the time! Off with his head!&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How dreadfully savage!&#x201d; exclaimed Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And ever since that,&#x201d; the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, &#x201c;he won&#x2019;t do a thing I ask! It&#x2019;s always six o&#x2019;clock now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;A bright idea came into Alice&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?&#x201d; she asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; said the Hatter with a sigh: &#x201c;it&#x2019;s always tea-time, and we&#x2019;ve no time to wash the things between whiles.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then you keep moving round, I suppose?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Exactly so,&#x201d; said the Hatter: &#x201c;as the things get used up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But what happens when you come to the beginning again?&#x201d; Alice ventured to ask.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Suppose we change the subject,&#x201d; the March Hare interrupted, yawning. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t know one,&#x201d; said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then the Dormouse shall!&#x201d; they both cried. &#x201c;Wake up, Dormouse!&#x201d; And they pinched it on both sides at once.&#013;&#013;The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t asleep,&#x201d; he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: &#x201c;I heard every word you fellows were saying.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tell us a story!&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, please do!&#x201d; pleaded Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And be quick about it,&#x201d; added the Hatter, &#x201c;or you&#x2019;ll be asleep again before it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Once upon a time there were three little sisters,&#x201d; the Dormouse began in a great hurry; &#x201c;and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What did they live on?&#x201d; said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They lived on treacle,&#x201d; said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t have done that, you know,&#x201d; Alice gently remarked; &#x201c;they&#x2019;d have been ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So they were,&#x201d; said the Dormouse; &#x201c;very ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: &#x201c;But why did they live at the bottom of a well?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Take some more tea,&#x201d; the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had nothing yet,&#x201d; Alice replied in an offended tone, &#x201c;so I can&#x2019;t take more.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You mean you can&#x2019;t take less,&#x201d; said the Hatter: &#x201c;it&#x2019;s very easy to take more than nothing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nobody asked your opinion,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s making personal remarks now?&#x201d; the Hatter asked triumphantly.&#013;&#013;Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. &#x201c;Why did they live at the bottom of a well?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, &#x201c;It was a treacle-well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing!&#x201d; Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went &#x201c;Sh! sh!&#x201d; and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t be civil, you&#x2019;d better finish the story for yourself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, please go on!&#x201d; Alice said very humbly; &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t interrupt again. I dare say there may be one.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;One, indeed!&#x201d; said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. &#x201c;And so these three little sisters&#x2014;they were learning to draw, you know&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What did they draw?&#x201d; said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Treacle,&#x201d; said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I want a clean cup,&#x201d; interrupted the Hatter: &#x201c;let&#x2019;s all move one place on.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse&#x2019;s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.&#013;&#013;Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You can draw water out of a water-well,&#x201d; said the Hatter; &#x201c;so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well&#x2014;eh, stupid?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But they were in the well,&#x201d; Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course they were,&#x201d; said the Dormouse; &#x201c;&#x2014;well in.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They were learning to draw,&#x201d; the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; &#x201c;and they drew all manner of things&#x2014;everything that begins with an M&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why with an M?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;Alice was silent.&#013;&#013;The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: &#x201c;&#x2014;that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness&#x2014;you know you say things are &#x201c;much of a muchness&#x201d;&#x2014;did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Really, now you ask me,&#x201d; said Alice, very much confused, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then you shouldn&#x2019;t talk,&#x201d; said the Hatter.&#013;&#013;This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;At any rate I&#x2019;ll never go there again!&#x201d; said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very curious!&#x201d; she thought. &#x201c;But everything&#x2019;s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.&#x201d; And in she went.&#013;&#013;Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. &#x201c;Now, I&#x2019;ll manage better this time,&#x201d; she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then&#x2014;she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.&#013;&#013;CHAPTER VIII.&#013;The Queen&#x2019;s Croquet-Ground&#013;A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, &#x201c;Look out now, Five! Don&#x2019;t go splashing paint over me like that!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t help it,&#x201d; said Five, in a sulky tone; &#x201c;Seven jogged my elbow.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;On which Seven looked up and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better not talk!&#x201d; said Five. &#x201c;I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What for?&#x201d; said the one who had spoken first.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s none of your business, Two!&#x201d; said Seven.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, it is his business!&#x201d; said Five, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ll tell him&#x2014;it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun &#x201c;Well, of all the unjust things&#x2014;&#x201d; when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Would you tell me,&#x201d; said Alice, a little timidly, &#x201c;why you are painting those roses?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, &#x201c;Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we&#x2019;re doing our best, afore she comes, to&#x2014;&#x201d; At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out &#x201c;The Queen! The Queen!&#x201d; and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.&#013;&#013;First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King&#x2019;s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.&#013;&#013;Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; &#x201c;and besides, what would be the use of a procession,&#x201d; thought she, &#x201c;if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn&#x2019;t see it?&#x201d; So she stood still where she was, and waited.&#013;&#013;When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely &#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d; She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Idiot!&#x201d; said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, child?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,&#x201d; said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, &#x201c;Why, they&#x2019;re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn&#x2019;t be afraid of them!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And who are these?&#x201d; said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How should I know?&#x201d; said Alice, surprised at her own courage. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no business of mine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed &#x201c;Off with her head! Off&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nonsense!&#x201d; said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.&#013;&#013;The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said &#x201c;Consider, my dear: she is only a child!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave &#x201c;Turn them over!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Get up!&#x201d; said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Leave off that!&#x201d; screamed the Queen. &#x201c;You make me giddy.&#x201d; And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, &#x201c;What have you been doing here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May it please your Majesty,&#x201d; said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, &#x201c;we were trying&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I see!&#x201d; said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. &#x201c;Off with their heads!&#x201d; and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You shan&#x2019;t be beheaded!&#x201d; said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are their heads off?&#x201d; shouted the Queen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!&#x201d; the soldiers shouted in reply.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right!&#x201d; shouted the Queen. &#x201c;Can you play croquet?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; shouted Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come on, then!&#x201d; roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a very fine day!&#x201d; said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; said Alice: &#x201c;&#x2014;where&#x2019;s the Duchess?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hush! Hush!&#x201d; said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered &#x201c;She&#x2019;s under sentence of execution.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What for?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you say &#x2018;What a pity!&#x2019;?&#x201d; the Rabbit asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Alice: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s at all a pity. I said &#x2018;What for?&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She boxed the Queen&#x2019;s ears&#x2014;&#x201d; the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. &#x201c;Oh, hush!&#x201d; the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. &#x201c;The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Get to your places!&#x201d; shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.&#013;&#013;The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.&#013;&#013;The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting &#x201c;Off with his head!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Off with her head!&#x201d; about once in a minute.&#013;&#013;Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, &#x201c;and then,&#x201d; thought she, &#x201c;what would become of me? They&#x2019;re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there&#x2019;s any one left alive!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How are you getting on?&#x201d; said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.&#013;&#013;Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no use speaking to it,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;till its ears have come, or at least one of them.&#x201d; In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they play at all fairly,&#x201d; Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, &#x201c;and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can&#x2019;t hear oneself speak&#x2014;and they don&#x2019;t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there&#x2019;s the arch I&#x2019;ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground&#x2014;and I should have croqueted the Queen&#x2019;s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How do you like the Queen?&#x201d; said the Cat in a low voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Alice: &#x201c;she&#x2019;s so extremely&#x2014;&#x201d; Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, &#x201c;&#x2014;likely to win, that it&#x2019;s hardly worth while finishing the game.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Queen smiled and passed on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are you talking to?&#x201d; said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat&#x2019;s head with great curiosity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a friend of mine&#x2014;a Cheshire Cat,&#x201d; said Alice: &#x201c;allow me to introduce it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like the look of it at all,&#x201d; said the King: &#x201c;however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not,&#x201d; the Cat remarked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be impertinent,&#x201d; said the King, &#x201c;and don&#x2019;t look at me like that!&#x201d; He got behind Alice as he spoke.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A cat may look at a king,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read that in some book, but I don&#x2019;t remember where.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, it must be removed,&#x201d; said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, &#x201c;My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. &#x201c;Off with his head!&#x201d; she said, without even looking round.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fetch the executioner myself,&#x201d; said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.&#013;&#013;Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen&#x2019;s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.&#013;&#013;The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.&#013;&#013;By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: &#x201c;but it doesn&#x2019;t matter much,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.&#x201d; So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.&#013;&#013;When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.&#013;&#013;The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.&#013;&#013;The executioner&#x2019;s argument was, that you couldn&#x2019;t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn&#x2019;t going to begin at his time of life.&#013;&#013;The King&#x2019;s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren&#x2019;t to talk nonsense.&#013;&#013;The Queen&#x2019;s argument was, that if something wasn&#x2019;t done about it in less than no time she&#x2019;d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)&#013;&#013;Alice could think of nothing else to say but &#x201c;It belongs to the Duchess: you&#x2019;d better ask her about it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in prison,&#x201d; the Queen said to the executioner: &#x201c;fetch her here.&#x201d; And the executioner went off like an arrow.&#013;&#013;The Cat&#x2019;s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.&#013;&#013;CHAPTER IX.&#013;The Mock Turtle&#x2019;s Story&#013;&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!&#x201d; said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice&#x2019;s, and they walked off together.&#013;&#013;Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When I&#x2019;m a Duchess,&#x201d; she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without&#x2014;Maybe it&#x2019;s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,&#x201d; she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, &#x201c;and vinegar that makes them sour&#x2014;and camomile that makes them bitter&#x2014;and&#x2014;and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn&#x2019;t be so stingy about it, you know&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can&#x2019;t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps it hasn&#x2019;t one,&#x201d; Alice ventured to remark.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tut, tut, child!&#x201d; said the Duchess. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s got a moral, if only you can find it.&#x201d; And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice&#x2019;s side as she spoke.&#013;&#013;Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice&#x2019;s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The game&#x2019;s going on rather better now,&#x201d; she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis so,&#x201d; said the Duchess: &#x201c;and the moral of that is&#x2014;&#x2018;Oh, &#x2019;tis love, &#x2019;tis love, that makes the world go round!&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Somebody said,&#x201d; Alice whispered, &#x201c;that it&#x2019;s done by everybody minding their own business!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah, well! It means much the same thing,&#x201d; said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice&#x2019;s shoulder as she added, &#x201c;and the moral of that is&#x2014;&#x2018;Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How fond she is of finding morals in things!&#x201d; Alice thought to herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I dare say you&#x2019;re wondering why I don&#x2019;t put my arm round your waist,&#x201d; the Duchess said after a pause: &#x201c;the reason is, that I&#x2019;m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He might bite,&#x201d; Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very true,&#x201d; said the Duchess: &#x201c;flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is&#x2014;&#x2018;Birds of a feather flock together.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Only mustard isn&#x2019;t a bird,&#x201d; Alice remarked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Right, as usual,&#x201d; said the Duchess: &#x201c;what a clear way you have of putting things!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mineral, I think,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is&#x2014;&#x2018;The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, I know!&#x201d; exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a vegetable. It doesn&#x2019;t look like one, but it is.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I quite agree with you,&#x201d; said the Duchess; &#x201c;and the moral of that is&#x2014;&#x2018;Be what you would seem to be&#x2019;&#x2014;or if you&#x2019;d like it put more simply&#x2014;&#x2018;Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think I should understand that better,&#x201d; Alice said very politely, &#x201c;if I had it written down: but I can&#x2019;t quite follow it as you say it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nothing to what I could say if I chose,&#x201d; the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pray don&#x2019;t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t talk about trouble!&#x201d; said the Duchess. &#x201c;I make you a present of everything I&#x2019;ve said as yet.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A cheap sort of present!&#x201d; thought Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad they don&#x2019;t give birthday presents like that!&#x201d; But she did not venture to say it out loud.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thinking again?&#x201d; the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a right to think,&#x201d; said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Just about as much right,&#x201d; said the Duchess, &#x201c;as pigs have to fly; and the m&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But here, to Alice&#x2019;s great surprise, the Duchess&#x2019;s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word &#x2018;moral,&#x2019; and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A fine day, your Majesty!&#x201d; the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now, I give you fair warning,&#x201d; shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; &#x201c;either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go on with the game,&#x201d; the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.&#013;&#013;The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen&#x2019;s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment&#x2019;s delay would cost them their lives.&#013;&#013;All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting &#x201c;Off with his head!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Off with her head!&#x201d; Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.&#013;&#013;Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, &#x201c;Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what a Mock Turtle is.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,&#x201d; said the Queen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never saw one, or heard of one,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come on, then,&#x201d; said the Queen, &#x201c;and he shall tell you his history,&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, &#x201c;You are all pardoned.&#x201d; &#x201c;Come, that&#x2019;s a good thing!&#x201d; she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.&#013;&#013;They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don&#x2019;t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) &#x201c;Up, lazy thing!&#x201d; said the Queen, &#x201c;and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;&#x201d; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.&#013;&#013;The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. &#x201c;What fun!&#x201d; said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is the fun?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, she,&#x201d; said the Gryphon. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Everybody says &#x2018;come on!&#x2019; here,&#x201d; thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: &#x201c;I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. &#x201c;What is his sorrow?&#x201d; she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all his fancy, that: he hasn&#x2019;t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This here young lady,&#x201d; said the Gryphon, &#x201c;she wants for to know your history, she do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell it her,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: &#x201c;sit down, both of you, and don&#x2019;t speak a word till I&#x2019;ve finished.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn&#x2019;t begin.&#x201d; But she waited patiently.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Once,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, &#x201c;I was a real Turtle.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of &#x201c;Hjckrrh!&#x201d; from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, &#x201c;Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,&#x201d; but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;When we were little,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, &#x201c;we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle&#x2014;we used to call him Tortoise&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn&#x2019;t one?&#x201d; Alice asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We called him Tortoise because he taught us,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle angrily: &#x201c;really you are very dull!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,&#x201d; added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, &#x201c;Drive on, old fellow! Don&#x2019;t be all day about it!&#x201d; and he went on in these words:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn&#x2019;t believe it&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never said I didn&#x2019;t!&#x201d; interrupted Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You did,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hold your tongue!&#x201d; added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We had the best of educations&#x2014;in fact, we went to school every day&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been to a day-school, too,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;you needn&#x2019;t be so proud as all that.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With extras?&#x201d; asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;we learned French and music.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And washing?&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly not!&#x201d; said Alice indignantly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah! then yours wasn&#x2019;t a really good school,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. &#x201c;Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, &#x2018;French, music, and washing&#x2014;extra.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t have wanted it much,&#x201d; said Alice; &#x201c;living at the bottom of the sea.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t afford to learn it.&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. &#x201c;I only took the regular course.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; inquired Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle replied; &#x201c;and then the different branches of Arithmetic&#x2014;Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never heard of &#x2018;Uglification,&#x2019;&#x201d; Alice ventured to say. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. &#x201c;What! Never heard of uglifying!&#x201d; it exclaimed. &#x201c;You know what to beautify is, I suppose?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Alice doubtfully: &#x201c;it means&#x2014;to&#x2014;make&#x2014;anything&#x2014;prettier.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; the Gryphon went on, &#x201c;if you don&#x2019;t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said &#x201c;What else had you to learn?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, there was Mystery,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, &#x201c;&#x2014;Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling&#x2014;the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What was that like?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, I can&#x2019;t show it you myself,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hadn&#x2019;t time,&#x201d; said the Gryphon: &#x201c;I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never went to him,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: &#x201c;he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So he did, so he did,&#x201d; said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And how many hours a day did you do lessons?&#x201d; said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ten hours the first day,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle: &#x201c;nine the next, and so on.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What a curious plan!&#x201d; exclaimed Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the reason they&#x2019;re called lessons,&#x201d; the Gryphon remarked: &#x201c;because they lessen from day to day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. &#x201c;Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course it was,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And how did you manage on the twelfth?&#x201d; Alice went on eagerly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough about lessons,&#x201d; the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: &#x201c;tell her something about the games now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER X.&#013;The Lobster Quadrille&#013;The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. &#x201c;Same as if he had a bone in his throat,&#x201d; said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may not have lived much under the sea&#x2014;&#x201d; (&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Alice)&#x2014;&#x201c;and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster&#x2014;&#x201d; (Alice began to say &#x201c;I once tasted&#x2014;&#x201d; but checked herself hastily, and said &#x201c;No, never&#x201d;) &#x201c;&#x2014;so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, indeed,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;What sort of a dance is it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why,&#x201d; said the Gryphon, &#x201c;you first form into a line along the sea-shore&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Two lines!&#x201d; cried the Mock Turtle. &#x201c;Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you&#x2019;ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That generally takes some time,&#x201d; interrupted the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2014;you advance twice&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Each with a lobster as a partner!&#x201d; cried the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle said: &#x201c;advance twice, set to partners&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2014;change lobsters, and retire in same order,&#x201d; continued the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then, you know,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle went on, &#x201c;you throw the&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The lobsters!&#x201d; shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2014;as far out to sea as you can&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Swim after them!&#x201d; screamed the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Turn a somersault in the sea!&#x201d; cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Change lobsters again!&#x201d; yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Back to land again, and that&#x2019;s all the first figure,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It must be a very pretty dance,&#x201d; said Alice timidly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Would you like to see a little of it?&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very much indeed,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s try the first figure!&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. &#x201c;We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, you sing,&#x201d; said the Gryphon. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve forgotten the words.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Will you walk a little faster?&#x201d; said a whiting to a snail.&#013;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a porpoise close behind us, and he&#x2019;s treading on my tail.&#013;See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!&#013;They are waiting on the shingle&#x2014;will you come and join the dance?&#013;Will you, won&#x2019;t you, will you, won&#x2019;t you, will you join the dance?&#013;Will you, won&#x2019;t you, will you, won&#x2019;t you, won&#x2019;t you join the dance?&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You can really have no notion how delightful it will be&#013;When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!&#x201d;&#013;But the snail replied &#x201c;Too far, too far!&#x201d; and gave a look askance&#x2014;&#013;Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.&#013;Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.&#013;Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What matters it how far we go?&#x201d; his scaly friend replied.&#013;&#x201c;There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.&#013;The further off from England the nearer is to France&#x2014;&#013;Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.&#013;Will you, won&#x2019;t you, will you, won&#x2019;t you, will you join the dance?&#013;Will you, won&#x2019;t you, will you, won&#x2019;t you, won&#x2019;t you join the dance?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thank you, it&#x2019;s a very interesting dance to watch,&#x201d; said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: &#x201c;and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, as to the whiting,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle, &#x201c;they&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve seen them, of course?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve often seen them at dinn&#x2014;&#x201d; she checked herself hastily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where Dinn may be,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle, &#x201c;but if you&#x2019;ve seen them so often, of course you know what they&#x2019;re like.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I believe so,&#x201d; Alice replied thoughtfully. &#x201c;They have their tails in their mouths&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re all over crumbs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong about the crumbs,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle: &#x201c;crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is&#x2014;&#x201d; here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.&#x2014;&#x201c;Tell her about the reason and all that,&#x201d; he said to the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The reason is,&#x201d; said the Gryphon, &#x201c;that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn&#x2019;t get them out again. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Alice, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can tell you more than that, if you like,&#x201d; said the Gryphon. &#x201c;Do you know why it&#x2019;s called a whiting?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I never thought about it,&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It does the boots and shoes,&#x201d; the Gryphon replied very solemnly.&#013;&#013;Alice was thoroughly puzzled. &#x201c;Does the boots and shoes!&#x201d; she repeated in a wondering tone.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, what are your shoes done with?&#x201d; said the Gryphon. &#x201c;I mean, what makes them so shiny?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re done with blacking, I believe.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boots and shoes under the sea,&#x201d; the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, &#x201c;are done with a whiting. Now you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And what are they made of?&#x201d; Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Soles and eels, of course,&#x201d; the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: &#x201c;any shrimp could have told you that.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If I&#x2019;d been the whiting,&#x201d; said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have said to the porpoise, &#x2018;Keep back, please: we don&#x2019;t want you with us!&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They were obliged to have him with them,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle said: &#x201c;no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it really?&#x201d; said Alice in a tone of great surprise.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle: &#x201c;why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say &#x2018;With what porpoise?&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you mean &#x2018;purpose&#x2019;?&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I mean what I say,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s hear some of your adventures.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I could tell you my adventures&#x2014;beginning from this morning,&#x201d; said Alice a little timidly: &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Explain all that,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no! The adventures first,&#x201d; said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: &#x201c;explanations take such a dreadful time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating &#x201c;You are old, Father William,&#x201d; to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very curious.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about as curious as it can be,&#x201d; said the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It all came different!&#x201d; the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. &#x201c;I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.&#x201d; He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Stand up and repeat &#x2018;&#x2019;Tis the voice of the sluggard,&#x2019;&#x201d; said the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!&#x201d; thought Alice; &#x201c;I might as well be at school at once.&#x201d; However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,&#013;&#x201c;You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.&#x201d;&#013;As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose&#013;Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;[later editions continued as follows&#013;When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,&#013;And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,&#013;But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,&#013;His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s different from what I used to say when I was a child,&#x201d; said the Gryphon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, I never heard it before,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle; &#x201c;but it sounds uncommon nonsense.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I should like to have it explained,&#x201d; said the Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She can&#x2019;t explain it,&#x201d; said the Gryphon hastily. &#x201c;Go on with the next verse.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But about his toes?&#x201d; the Mock Turtle persisted. &#x201c;How could he turn them out with his nose, you know?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the first position in dancing.&#x201d; Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Go on with the next verse,&#x201d; the Gryphon repeated impatiently: &#x201c;it begins &#x2018;I passed by his garden.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,&#013;How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;[later editions continued as follows&#013;The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,&#013;While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.&#013;When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,&#013;Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:&#013;While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,&#013;And concluded the banquet&#x2014;]&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is the use of repeating all that stuff,&#x201d; the Mock Turtle interrupted, &#x201c;if you don&#x2019;t explain it as you go on? It&#x2019;s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I think you&#x2019;d better leave off,&#x201d; said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?&#x201d; the Gryphon went on. &#x201c;Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,&#x201d; Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, &#x201c;Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her &#x2018;Turtle Soup,&#x2019; will you, old fellow?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,&#013;Waiting in a hot tureen!&#013;Who for such dainties would not stoop?&#013;Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!&#013;Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!&#013;    Beau&#x2014;ootiful Soo&#x2014;oop!&#013;    Beau&#x2014;ootiful Soo&#x2014;oop!&#013;Soo&#x2014;oop of the e&#x2014;e&#x2014;evening,&#013;    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,&#013;Game, or any other dish?&#013;Who would not give all else for two p&#013;ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?&#013;Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?&#013;    Beau&#x2014;ootiful Soo&#x2014;oop!&#013;    Beau&#x2014;ootiful Soo&#x2014;oop!&#013;Soo&#x2014;oop of the e&#x2014;e&#x2014;evening,&#013;    Beautiful, beauti&#x2014;FUL SOUP!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Chorus again!&#x201d; cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of &#x201c;The trial&#x2019;s beginning!&#x201d; was heard in the distance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What trial is it?&#x201d; Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Soo&#x2014;oop of the e&#x2014;e&#x2014;evening,&#013;    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER XI.&#013;Who Stole the Tarts?&#013;The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them&#x2014;all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them&#x2014;&#x201c;I wish they&#x2019;d get the trial done,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;and hand round the refreshments!&#x201d; But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.&#013;&#013;Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the judge,&#x201d; she said to herself, &#x201c;because of his great wig.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s the jury-box,&#x201d; thought Alice, &#x201c;and those twelve creatures,&#x201d; (she was obliged to say &#x201c;creatures,&#x201d; you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) &#x201c;I suppose they are the jurors.&#x201d; She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, &#x201c;jury-men&#x201d; would have done just as well.&#013;&#013;The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. &#x201c;What are they doing?&#x201d; Alice whispered to the Gryphon. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t have anything to put down yet, before the trial&#x2019;s begun.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re putting down their names,&#x201d; the Gryphon whispered in reply, &#x201c;for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Stupid things!&#x201d; Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, &#x201c;Silence in the court!&#x201d; and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.&#013;&#013;Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down &#x201c;stupid things!&#x201d; on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn&#x2019;t know how to spell &#x201c;stupid,&#x201d; and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. &#x201c;A nice muddle their slates&#x2019;ll be in before the trial&#x2019;s over!&#x201d; thought Alice.&#013;&#013;One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Herald, read the accusation!&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,&#013;    All on a summer day:&#013;The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,&#013;    And took them quite away!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Consider your verdict,&#x201d; the King said to the jury.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not yet, not yet!&#x201d; the Rabbit hastily interrupted. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a great deal to come before that!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Call the first witness,&#x201d; said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, &#x201c;First witness!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. &#x201c;I beg pardon, your Majesty,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;for bringing these in: but I hadn&#x2019;t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You ought to have finished,&#x201d; said the King. &#x201c;When did you begin?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. &#x201c;Fourteenth of March, I think it was,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Fifteenth,&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sixteenth,&#x201d; added the Dormouse.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Write that down,&#x201d; the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Take off your hat,&#x201d; the King said to the Hatter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t mine,&#x201d; said the Hatter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Stolen!&#x201d; the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I keep them to sell,&#x201d; the Hatter added as an explanation; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve none of my own. I&#x2019;m a hatter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Give your evidence,&#x201d; said the King; &#x201c;and don&#x2019;t be nervous, or I&#x2019;ll have you executed on the spot.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.&#013;&#013;Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t squeeze so.&#x201d; said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. &#x201c;I can hardly breathe.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it,&#x201d; said Alice very meekly: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m growing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no right to grow here,&#x201d; said the Dormouse.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk nonsense,&#x201d; said Alice more boldly: &#x201c;you know you&#x2019;re growing too.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,&#x201d; said the Dormouse: &#x201c;not in that ridiculous fashion.&#x201d; And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.&#013;&#013;All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, &#x201c;Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!&#x201d; on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Give your evidence,&#x201d; the King repeated angrily, &#x201c;or I&#x2019;ll have you executed, whether you&#x2019;re nervous or not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a poor man, your Majesty,&#x201d; the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, &#x201c;&#x2014;and I hadn&#x2019;t begun my tea&#x2014;not above a week or so&#x2014;and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin&#x2014;and the twinkling of the tea&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The twinkling of the what?&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It began with the tea,&#x201d; the Hatter replied.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course twinkling begins with a T!&#x201d; said the King sharply. &#x201c;Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a poor man,&#x201d; the Hatter went on, &#x201c;and most things twinkled after that&#x2014;only the March Hare said&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t!&#x201d; the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You did!&#x201d; said the Hatter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I deny it!&#x201d; said the March Hare.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He denies it,&#x201d; said the King: &#x201c;leave out that part.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said&#x2014;&#x201d; the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;After that,&#x201d; continued the Hatter, &#x201c;I cut some more bread-and-butter&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But what did the Dormouse say?&#x201d; one of the jury asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That I can&#x2019;t remember,&#x201d; said the Hatter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must remember,&#x201d; remarked the King, &#x201c;or I&#x2019;ll have you executed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a poor man, your Majesty,&#x201d; he began.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a very poor speaker,&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;ve seen that done,&#x201d; thought Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, &#x201c;There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,&#x201d; and I never understood what it meant till now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s all you know about it, you may stand down,&#x201d; continued the King.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go no lower,&#x201d; said the Hatter: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on the floor, as it is.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then you may sit down,&#x201d; the King replied.&#013;&#013;Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!&#x201d; thought Alice. &#x201c;Now we shall get on better.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather finish my tea,&#x201d; said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You may go,&#x201d; said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;&#x2014;and just take his head off outside,&#x201d; the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Call the next witness!&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;The next witness was the Duchess&#x2019;s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Give your evidence,&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shan&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said the cook.&#013;&#013;The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, &#x201c;Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, if I must, I must,&#x201d; the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, &#x201c;What are tarts made of?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pepper, mostly,&#x201d; said the cook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Treacle,&#x201d; said a sleepy voice behind her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Collar that Dormouse,&#x201d; the Queen shrieked out. &#x201c;Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Never mind!&#x201d; said the King, with an air of great relief. &#x201c;Call the next witness.&#x201d; And he added in an undertone to the Queen, &#x201c;Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, &#x201c;&#x2014;for they haven&#x2019;t got much evidence yet,&#x201d; she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name &#x201c;Alice!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER XII.&#013;Alice&#x2019;s Evidence&#013;&#x201c;Here!&#x201d; cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, I beg your pardon!&#x201d; she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The trial cannot proceed,&#x201d; said the King in a very grave voice, &#x201c;until all the jurymen are back in their proper places&#x2014;all,&#x201d; he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.&#013;&#013;Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; &#x201c;not that it signifies much,&#x201d; she said to herself; &#x201c;I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you know about this business?&#x201d; the King said to Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing whatever?&#x201d; persisted the King.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing whatever,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very important,&#x201d; the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: &#x201c;Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,&#x201d; he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Unimportant, of course, I meant,&#x201d; the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,&#013;&#013;&#x201c;important&#x2014;unimportant&#x2014;unimportant&#x2014;important&#x2014;&#x201d; as if he were trying which word sounded best.&#013;&#013;Some of the jury wrote it down &#x201c;important,&#x201d; and some &#x201c;unimportant.&#x201d; Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; &#x201c;but it doesn&#x2019;t matter a bit,&#x201d; she thought to herself.&#013;&#013;At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out &#x201c;Silence!&#x201d; and read out from his book, &#x201c;Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Everybody looked at Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a mile high,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are,&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nearly two miles high,&#x201d; added the Queen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, I shan&#x2019;t go, at any rate,&#x201d; said Alice: &#x201c;besides, that&#x2019;s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the oldest rule in the book,&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then it ought to be Number One,&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. &#x201c;Consider your verdict,&#x201d; he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,&#x201d; said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; &#x201c;this paper has just been picked up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in it?&#x201d; said the Queen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t opened it yet,&#x201d; said the White Rabbit, &#x201c;but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to&#x2014;to somebody.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It must have been that,&#x201d; said the King, &#x201c;unless it was written to nobody, which isn&#x2019;t usual, you know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who is it directed to?&#x201d; said one of the jurymen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t directed at all,&#x201d; said the White Rabbit; &#x201c;in fact, there&#x2019;s nothing written on the outside.&#x201d; He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t a letter, after all: it&#x2019;s a set of verses.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are they in the prisoner&#x2019;s handwriting?&#x201d; asked another of the jurymen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; said the White Rabbit, &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s the queerest thing about it.&#x201d; (The jury all looked puzzled.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He must have imitated somebody else&#x2019;s hand,&#x201d; said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Please your Majesty,&#x201d; said the Knave, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t write it, and they can&#x2019;t prove I did: there&#x2019;s no name signed at the end.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t sign it,&#x201d; said the King, &#x201c;that only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you&#x2019;d have signed your name like an honest man.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That proves his guilt,&#x201d; said the Queen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It proves nothing of the sort!&#x201d; said Alice. &#x201c;Why, you don&#x2019;t even know what they&#x2019;re about!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Read them,&#x201d; said the King.&#013;&#013;The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. &#x201c;Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?&#x201d; he asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Begin at the beginning,&#x201d; the King said gravely, &#x201c;and go on till you come to the end: then stop.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;These were the verses the White Rabbit read:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They told me you had been to her,&#013;    And mentioned me to him:&#013;She gave me a good character,&#013;    But said I could not swim.&#013;&#013;He sent them word I had not gone&#013;    (We know it to be true):&#013;If she should push the matter on,&#013;    What would become of you?&#013;&#013;I gave her one, they gave him two,&#013;    You gave us three or more;&#013;They all returned from him to you,&#013;    Though they were mine before.&#013;&#013;If I or she should chance to be&#013;    Involved in this affair,&#013;He trusts to you to set them free,&#013;    Exactly as we were.&#013;&#013;My notion was that you had been&#013;    (Before she had this fit)&#013;An obstacle that came between&#013;    Him, and ourselves, and it.&#013;&#013;Don&#x2019;t let him know she liked them best,&#013;    For this must ever be&#013;A secret, kept from all the rest,&#013;    Between yourself and me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the most important piece of evidence we&#x2019;ve heard yet,&#x201d; said the King, rubbing his hands; &#x201c;so now let the jury&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If any one of them can explain it,&#x201d; said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn&#x2019;t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give him sixpence. I don&#x2019;t believe there&#x2019;s an atom of meaning in it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The jury all wrote down on their slates, &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t believe there&#x2019;s an atom of meaning in it,&#x201d; but none of them attempted to explain the paper.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If there&#x2019;s no meaning in it,&#x201d; said the King, &#x201c;that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn&#x2019;t try to find any. And yet I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; &#x201c;I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. &#x201c;&#x2014;said I could not swim&#x2014;&#x201d; you can&#x2019;t swim, can you?&#x201d; he added, turning to the Knave.&#013;&#013;The Knave shook his head sadly. &#x201c;Do I look like it?&#x201d; he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All right, so far,&#x201d; said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: &#x201c;&#x2018;We know it to be true&#x2014;&#x2019; that&#x2019;s the jury, of course&#x2014;&#x2018;I gave her one, they gave him two&#x2014;&#x2019; why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, it goes on &#x2018;they all returned from him to you,&#x2019;&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, there they are!&#x201d; said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. &#x201c;Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again&#x2014;&#x2018;before she had this fit&#x2014;&#x2019; you never had fits, my dear, I think?&#x201d; he said to the Queen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Never!&#x201d; said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then the words don&#x2019;t fit you,&#x201d; said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pun!&#x201d; the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, &#x201c;Let the jury consider their verdict,&#x201d; the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no!&#x201d; said the Queen. &#x201c;Sentence first&#x2014;verdict afterwards.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Stuff and nonsense!&#x201d; said Alice loudly. &#x201c;The idea of having the sentence first!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hold your tongue!&#x201d; said the Queen, turning purple.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t!&#x201d; said Alice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Off with her head!&#x201d; the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who cares for you?&#x201d; said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nothing but a pack of cards!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wake up, Alice dear!&#x201d; said her sister; &#x201c;Why, what a long sleep you&#x2019;ve had!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve had such a curious dream!&#x201d; said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, &#x201c;It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it&#x2019;s getting late.&#x201d; So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.&#013;&#013;But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers&#x2014;she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes&#x2014;and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister&#x2019;s dream.&#013;&#013;The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by&#x2014;the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool&#x2014;she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution&#x2014;once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess&#x2019;s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it&#x2014;once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard&#x2019;s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.&#013;&#013;So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality&#x2014;the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds&#x2014;the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen&#x2019;s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy&#x2014;and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard&#x2014;while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle&#x2019;s heavy sobs.&#013;&#013;Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.&#013;&#013;THE END",

        "content": "It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.&#013;&#013;A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity&#x2014;but that would be asking too much of fate!&#013;&#013;Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.&#013;&#013;Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?&#013;&#013;John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.&#013;&#013;John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.&#013;&#013;John is a physician, and perhaps&#x2014;(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)&#x2014;perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.&#013;&#013;You see, he does not believe I am sick!&#013;&#013;And what can one do?&#013;&#013;If a physician of high standing, and one&#x2019;s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression&#x2014;a slight hysterical tendency&#x2014;what is one to do?&#013;&#013;My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing.&#013;&#013;So I take phosphates or phosphites&#x2014;whichever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to &#x201c;work&#x201d; until I am well again.&#013;&#013;Personally, I disagree with their ideas.&#013;&#013;Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.&#013;&#013;But what is one to do?&#013;&#013;I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal&#x2014;having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.&#013;&#013;I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus&#x2014;but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.&#013;&#013;So I will let it alone and talk about the house.&#013;&#013;The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.&#013;&#013;There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden&#x2014;large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.&#013;&#013;There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.&#013;&#013;There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.&#013;&#013;That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don&#x2019;t care&#x2014;there is something strange about the house&#x2014;I can feel it.&#013;&#013;I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a draught, and shut the window.&#013;&#013;I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I&#x2019;m sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.&#013;&#013;But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself,&#x2014;before him, at least,&#x2014;and that makes me very tired.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.&#013;&#013;He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.&#013;&#013;He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.&#013;&#013;I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.&#013;&#013;He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. &#x201c;Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time.&#x201d; So we took the nursery, at the top of the house.&#013;&#013;It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.&#013;&#013;The paint and paper look as if a boys&#x2019; school had used it. It is stripped off&#x2014;the paper&#x2014;in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.&#013;&#013;One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.&#013;&#013;It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame, uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide&#x2014;plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions.&#013;&#013;The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.&#013;&#013;It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others.&#013;&#013;No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long.&#013;&#013;There comes John, and I must put this away,&#x2014;he hates to have me write a word.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;We have been here two weeks, and I haven&#x2019;t felt like writing before, since that first day.&#013;&#013;I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.&#013;&#013;John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.&#013;&#013;I am glad my case is not serious!&#013;&#013;But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.&#013;&#013;John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.&#013;&#013;Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!&#013;&#013;I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!&#013;&#013;Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able&#x2014;to dress and entertain, and order things.&#013;&#013;It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!&#013;&#013;And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.&#013;&#013;I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wallpaper!&#013;&#013;At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.&#013;&#013;He said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You know the place is doing you good,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and really, dear, I don&#x2019;t care to renovate the house just for a three months&#x2019; rental.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then do let us go downstairs,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;there are such pretty rooms there.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.&#013;&#013;But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.&#013;&#013;It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.&#013;&#013;I&#x2019;m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.&#013;&#013;Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.&#013;&#013;Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.&#013;&#013;I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.&#013;&#013;But I find I get pretty tired when I try.&#013;&#013;It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.&#013;&#013;I wish I could get well faster.&#013;&#013;But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!&#013;&#013;There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.&#013;&#013;I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn&#x2019;t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.&#013;&#013;I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy-store.&#013;&#013;I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.&#013;&#013;I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe.&#013;&#013;The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never saw such ravages as the children have made here.&#013;&#013;The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother&#x2014;they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.&#013;&#013;Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.&#013;&#013;But I don&#x2019;t mind it a bit&#x2014;only the paper.&#013;&#013;There comes John&#x2019;s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of me! I must not let her find me writing.&#013;&#013;She is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick!&#013;&#013;But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these windows.&#013;&#013;There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road, and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows.&#013;&#013;This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.&#013;&#013;But in the places where it isn&#x2019;t faded, and where the sun is just so, I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.&#013;&#013;There&#x2019;s sister on the stairs!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.&#013;&#013;Of course I didn&#x2019;t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.&#013;&#013;But it tired me all the same.&#013;&#013;John says if I don&#x2019;t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.&#013;&#013;But I don&#x2019;t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!&#013;&#013;Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I&#x2019;m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.&#013;&#013;I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.&#013;&#013;Of course I don&#x2019;t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.&#013;&#013;And I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.&#013;&#013;So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.&#013;&#013;I&#x2019;m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps because of the wallpaper.&#013;&#013;It dwells in my mind so!&#013;&#013;I lie here on this great immovable bed&#x2014;it is nailed down, I believe&#x2014;and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you. I start, we&#x2019;ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.&#013;&#013;I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.&#013;&#013;It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.&#013;&#013;Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes&#x2014;a kind of &#x201c;debased Romanesque&#x201d; with delirium tremens&#x2014;go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.&#013;&#013;But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.&#013;&#013;The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.&#013;&#013;They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.&#013;&#013;There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation after all,&#x2014;the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction.&#013;&#013;It makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t know why I should write this.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t want to.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t feel able.&#013;&#013;And I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and think in some way&#x2014;it is such a relief!&#013;&#013;But the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.&#013;&#013;Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.&#013;&#013;John says I musn&#x2019;t lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.&#013;&#013;Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.&#013;&#013;But he said I wasn&#x2019;t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.&#013;&#013;It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness, I suppose.&#013;&#013;And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head.&#013;&#013;He said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.&#013;&#013;He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.&#013;&#013;There&#x2019;s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper.&#013;&#013;If we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate escape! Why, I wouldn&#x2019;t have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds.&#013;&#013;I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.&#013;&#013;Of course I never mention it to them any more,&#x2014;I am too wise,&#x2014;but I keep watch of it all the same.&#013;&#013;There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.&#013;&#013;Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.&#013;&#013;It is always the same shape, only very numerous.&#013;&#013;And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don&#x2019;t like it a bit. I wonder&#x2014;I begin to think&#x2014;I wish John would take me away from here!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so.&#013;&#013;But I tried it last night.&#013;&#013;It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.&#013;&#013;I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.&#013;&#013;John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.&#013;&#013;The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.&#013;&#013;I got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and when I came back John was awake.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is it, little girl?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go walking about like that&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll get cold.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;I thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why darling!&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;our lease will be up in three weeks, and I can&#x2019;t see how to leave before.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t weigh a bit more,&#x201d; said I, &#x201c;nor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Bless her little heart!&#x201d; said he with a big hug; &#x201c;she shall be as sick as she pleases! But now let&#x2019;s improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And you won&#x2019;t go away?&#x201d; I asked gloomily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house ready. Really, dear, you are better!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Better in body perhaps&#x201d;&#x2014;I began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My darling,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;I beg of you, for my sake and for our child&#x2019;s sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn&#x2019;t,&#x2014;I lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.&#013;&#013;On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.&#013;&#013;The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.&#013;&#013;You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in following, it turns a back somersault and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad dream.&#013;&#013;The outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,&#x2014;why, that is something like it.&#013;&#013;That is, sometimes!&#013;&#013;There is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.&#013;&#013;When the sun shoots in through the east window&#x2014;I always watch for that first long, straight ray&#x2014;it changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it.&#013;&#013;That is why I watch it always.&#013;&#013;By moonlight&#x2014;the moon shines in all night when there is a moon&#x2014;I wouldn&#x2019;t know it was the same paper.&#013;&#013;At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and worst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be.&#013;&#013;I didn&#x2019;t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind,&#x2014;that dim sub-pattern,&#x2014;but now I am quite sure it is a woman.&#013;&#013;By daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.&#013;&#013;I lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can.&#013;&#013;Indeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal.&#013;&#013;It is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don&#x2019;t sleep.&#013;&#013;And that cultivates deceit, for I don&#x2019;t tell them I&#x2019;m awake,&#x2014;oh, no!&#013;&#013;The fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.&#013;&#013;He seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.&#013;&#013;It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that perhaps it is the paper!&#013;&#013;I have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I&#x2019;ve caught him several times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with her hand on it once.&#013;&#013;She didn&#x2019;t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry&#x2014;asked me why I should frighten her so!&#013;&#013;Then she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John&#x2019;s, and she wished we would be more careful!&#013;&#013;Did not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was.&#013;&#013;John is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.&#013;&#013;I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper&#x2014;he would make fun of me. He might even want to take me away.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that will be enough.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;I&#x2019;m feeling ever so much better! I don&#x2019;t sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.&#013;&#013;In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.&#013;&#013;There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.&#013;&#013;It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw&#x2014;not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.&#013;&#013;But there is something else about that paper&#x2014;the smell! I noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not, the smell is here.&#013;&#013;It creeps all over the house.&#013;&#013;I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.&#013;&#013;It gets into my hair.&#013;&#013;Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it&#x2014;there is that smell!&#013;&#013;Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like.&#013;&#013;It is not bad&#x2014;at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.&#013;&#013;In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me.&#013;&#013;It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the house&#x2014;to reach the smell.&#013;&#013;But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper! A yellow smell.&#013;&#013;There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had been rubbed over and over.&#013;&#013;I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round&#x2014;round and round and round&#x2014;it makes me dizzy!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;I really have discovered something at last.&#013;&#013;Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.&#013;&#013;The front pattern does move&#x2014;and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!&#013;&#013;Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.&#013;&#013;Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.&#013;&#013;And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern&#x2014;it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads.&#013;&#013;They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!&#013;&#013;If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;I think that woman gets out in the daytime!&#013;&#013;And I&#x2019;ll tell you why&#x2014;privately&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve seen her!&#013;&#013;I can see her out of every one of my windows!&#013;&#013;It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.&#013;&#013;I see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.&#013;&#013;I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight!&#013;&#013;I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can&#x2019;t do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once.&#013;&#013;And John is so queer now, that I don&#x2019;t want to irritate him. I wish he would take another room! Besides, I don&#x2019;t want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.&#013;&#013;I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.&#013;&#013;But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.&#013;&#013;And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can turn!&#013;&#013;I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean to try it, little by little.&#013;&#013;I have found out another funny thing, but I shan&#x2019;t tell it this time! It does not do to trust people too much.&#013;&#013;There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is beginning to notice. I don&#x2019;t like the look in his eyes.&#013;&#013;And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She had a very good report to give.&#013;&#013;She said I slept a good deal in the daytime.&#013;&#013;John knows I don&#x2019;t sleep very well at night, for all I&#x2019;m so quiet!&#013;&#013;He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind.&#013;&#013;As if I couldn&#x2019;t see through him!&#013;&#013;Still, I don&#x2019;t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three months.&#013;&#013;It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town over night, and won&#x2019;t be out until this evening.&#013;&#013;Jennie wanted to sleep with me&#x2014;the sly thing! but I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.&#013;&#013;That was clever, for really I wasn&#x2019;t alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her.&#013;&#013;I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.&#013;&#013;A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.&#013;&#013;And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me I declared I would finish it to-day!&#013;&#013;We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before.&#013;&#013;Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.&#013;&#013;She laughed and said she wouldn&#x2019;t mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.&#013;&#013;How she betrayed herself that time!&#013;&#013;But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me&#x2014;not alive!&#013;&#013;She tried to get me out of the room&#x2014;it was too patent! But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner&#x2014;I would call when I woke.&#013;&#013;So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.&#013;&#013;We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.&#013;&#013;I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.&#013;&#013;How those children did tear about here!&#013;&#013;This bedstead is fairly gnawed!&#013;&#013;But I must get to work.&#013;&#013;I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t want to go out, and I don&#x2019;t want to have anybody come in, till John comes.&#013;&#013;I want to astonish him.&#013;&#013;I&#x2019;ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!&#013;&#013;But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!&#013;&#013;This bed will not move!&#013;&#013;I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece at one corner&#x2014;but it hurt my teeth.&#013;&#013;Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!&#013;&#013;I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try.&#013;&#013;Besides I wouldn&#x2019;t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued.&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t like to look out of the windows even&#x2014;there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast.&#013;&#013;I wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?&#013;&#013;But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t get me out in the road there!&#013;&#013;I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard!&#013;&#013;It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!&#013;&#013;I don&#x2019;t want to go outside. I won&#x2019;t, even if Jennie asks me to.&#013;&#013;For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.&#013;&#013;But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.&#013;&#013;Why, there&#x2019;s John at the door!&#013;&#013;It is no use, young man, you can&#x2019;t open it!&#013;&#013;How he does call and pound!&#013;&#013;Now he&#x2019;s crying for an axe.&#013;&#013;It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John dear!&#x201d; said I in the gentlest voice, &#x201c;the key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;That silenced him for a few moments.&#013;&#013;Then he said&#x2014;very quietly indeed, &#x201c;Open the door, my darling!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said I. &#x201c;The key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course, and came in. He stopped short by the door.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is the matter?&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, what are you doing!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got out at last,&#x201d; said I, &#x201c;in spite of you and Jennie! And I&#x2019;ve pulled off most of the paper, so you can&#x2019;t put me back!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!",

It is as if we were speaking alone to no ears but our own. And we know well that there is no transgression blacker than to do or think alone. We have broken the laws. The laws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations bid them so. May we be forgiven!&#013;&#013;But this is not the only sin upon us. We have committed a greater crime, and for this crime there is no name. What punishment awaits us if it be discovered we know not, for no such crime has come in the memory of men and there are no laws to provide for it.&#013;&#013;It is dark here. The flame of the candle stands still in the air. Nothing moves in this tunnel save our hand on the paper. We are alone here under the earth. It is a fearful word, alone. The laws say that none among men may be alone, ever and at any time, for this is the great transgression and the root of all evil. But we have broken many laws. And now there is nothing here save our one body, and it is strange to see only two legs stretched on the ground, and on the wall before us the shadow of our one head.&#013;&#013;The walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads without sound, black and glistening as blood. We stole the candle from the larder of the Home of the Street Sweepers. We shall be sentenced to ten years in the Palace of Corrective Detention if it be discovered. But this matters not. It matters only that the light is precious and we should not waste it to write when we need it for that work which is our crime. Nothing matters save the work, our secret, our evil, our precious work. Still, we must also write, for&#x2014;may the Council have mercy upon us!&#x2014;we wish to speak for once to no ears but our own.&#013;&#013;Our name is Equality 7-2521, as it is written on the iron bracelet which all men wear on their left wrists with their names upon it. We are twenty-one years old. We are six feet tall, and this is a burden, for there are not many men who are six feet tall. Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed to us and frowned and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521, for your body has grown beyond the bodies of your brothers.&#x201d; But we cannot change our bones nor our body.&#013;&#013;We were born with a curse. It has always driven us to thoughts which are forbidden. It has always given us wishes which men may not wish. We know that we are evil, but there is no will in us and no power to resist it. This is our wonder and our secret fear, that we know and do not resist.&#013;&#013;We strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be alike. Over the portals of the Palace of the World Council, there are words cut in the marble, which we repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted:&#013;&#013;  &#x201c;WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE.&#013;  THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT WE,&#013;  ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER.&#x201d;&#013;We repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not.&#013;&#013;These words were cut long ago. There is green mould in the grooves of the letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more years than men could count. And these words are the truth, for they are written on the Palace of the World Council, and the World Council is the body of all truth. Thus has it been ever since the Great Rebirth, and farther back than that no memory can reach.&#013;&#013;But we must never speak of the times before the Great Rebirth, else we are sentenced to three years in the Palace of Corrective Detention. It is only the Old Ones who whisper about it in the evenings, in the Home of the Useless. They whisper many strange things, of the towers which rose to the sky, in those Unmentionable Times, and of the wagons which moved without horses, and of the lights which burned without flame. But those times were evil. And those times passed away, when men saw the Great Truth which is this: that all men are one and that there is no will save the will of all men together.&#013;&#013;All men are good and wise. It is only we, Equality 7-2521, we alone who were born with a curse. For we are not like our brothers. And as we look back upon our life, we see that it has ever been thus and that it has brought us step by step to our last, supreme transgression, our crime of crimes hidden here under the ground.&#013;&#013;We remember the Home of the Infants where we lived till we were five years old, together with all the children of the City who had been born in the same year. The sleeping halls there were white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds. We were just like all our brothers then, save for the one transgression: we fought with our brothers. There are few offenses blacker than to fight with our brothers, at any age and for any cause whatsoever. The Council of the Home told us so, and of all the children of that year, we were locked in the cellar most often.&#013;&#013;When we were five years old, we were sent to the Home of the Students, where there are ten wards, for our ten years of learning. Men must learn till they reach their fifteenth year. Then they go to work. In the Home of the Students we arose when the big bell rang in the tower and we went to our beds when it rang again. Before we removed our garments, we stood in the great sleeping hall, and we raised our right arms, and we said all together with the three Teachers at the head:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are nothing. Mankind is all. By the grace of our brothers are we allowed our lives. We exist through, by and for our brothers who are the State. Amen.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we slept. The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds.&#013;&#013;We, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in the Home of the Students. It was not that the learning was too hard for us. It was that the learning was too easy. This is a great sin, to be born with a head which is too quick. It is not good to be different from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior to them. The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked upon us.&#013;&#013;So we fought against this curse. We tried to forget our lessons, but we always remembered. We tried not to understand what the Teachers taught, but we always understood it before the Teachers had spoken. We looked upon Union 5-3992, who were a pale boy with only half a brain, and we tried to say and do as they did, that we might be like them, like Union 5-3992, but somehow the Teachers knew that we were not. And we were lashed more often than all the other children.&#013;&#013;The Teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the Councils, and the Councils are the voice of all justice, for they are the voice of all men. And if sometimes, in the secret darkness of our heart, we regret that which befell us on our fifteenth birthday, we know that it was through our own guilt. We had broken a law, for we had not paid heed to the words of our Teachers. The Teachers had said to us all:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dare not choose in your minds the work you would like to do when you leave the Home of the Students. You shall do that which the Council of Vocations shall prescribe for you. For the Council of Vocations knows in its great wisdom where you are needed by your brother men, better than you can know it in your unworthy little minds. And if you are not needed by your brother man, there is no reason for you to burden the earth with your bodies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We knew this well, in the years of our childhood, but our curse broke our will. We were guilty and we confess it here: we were guilty of the great Transgression of Preference. We preferred some work and some lessons to the others. We did not listen well to the history of all the Councils elected since the Great Rebirth. But we loved the Science of Things. We wished to know. We wished to know about all the things which make the earth around us. We asked so many questions that the Teachers forbade it.&#013;&#013;We think that there are mysteries in the sky and under the water and in the plants which grow. But the Council of Scholars has said that there are no mysteries, and the Council of Scholars knows all things. And we learned much from our Teachers. We learned that the earth is flat and that the sun revolves around it, which causes the day and the night. We learned the names of all the winds which blow over the seas and push the sails of our great ships. We learned how to bleed men to cure them of all ailments.&#013;&#013;We loved the Science of Things. And in the darkness, in the secret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only their shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars when our time would come.&#013;&#013;All the great modern inventions come from the Home of the Scholars, such as the newest one, which was found only a hundred years ago, of how to make candles from wax and string; also, how to make glass, which is put in our windows to protect us from the rain. To find these things, the Scholars must study the earth and learn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and the rocks. And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn from these also. We could ask questions of these, for they do not forbid questions.&#013;&#013;And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us seek we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It whispers to us that there are great things on this earth of ours, and that we can know them if we try, and that we must know them. We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us. We must know that we may know.&#013;&#013;So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. We wished it so much that our hands trembled under the blankets in the night, and we bit our arm to stop that other pain which we could not endure. It was evil and we dared not face our brothers in the morning. For men may wish nothing for themselves. And we were punished when the Council of Vocations came to give us our life Mandates which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what their work is to be for the rest of their days.&#013;&#013;The Council of Vocations came on the first day of spring, and they sat in the great hall. And we who were fifteen and all the Teachers came into the great hall. And the Council of Vocations sat on a high dais, and they had but two words to speak to each of the Students. They called the Students&#x2019; names, and when the Students stepped before them, one after another, the Council said: &#x201c;Carpenter&#x201d; or &#x201c;Doctor&#x201d; or &#x201c;Cook&#x201d; or &#x201c;Leader.&#x201d; Then each Student raised their right arm and said: &#x201c;The will of our brothers be done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now if the Council has said &#x201c;Carpenter&#x201d; or &#x201c;Cook,&#x201d; the Students so assigned go to work and they do not study any further. But if the Council has said &#x201c;Leader,&#x201d; then those Students go into the Home of the Leaders, which is the greatest house in the City, for it has three stories. And there they study for many years, so that they may become candidates and be elected to the City Council and the State Council and the World Council&#x2014;by a free and general vote of all men. But we wished not to be a Leader, even though it is a great honor. We wished to be a Scholar.&#013;&#013;So we awaited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the Council of Vocations call our name: &#x201c;Equality 7-2521.&#x201d; We walked to the dais, and our legs did not tremble, and we looked up at the Council. There were five members of the Council, three of the male gender and two of the female. Their hair was white and their faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed. They were old. They seemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World Council. They sat before us and they did not move. And we saw no breath to stir the folds of their white togas. But we knew that they were alive, for a finger of the hand of the oldest rose, pointed to us, and fell down again. This was the only thing which moved, for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said: &#x201c;Street Sweeper.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher to look upon the faces of the Council, and we were happy. We knew we had been guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it. We would accept our Life Mandate, and we would work for our brothers, gladly and willingly, and we would erase our sin against them, which they did not know, but we knew. So we were happy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over ourselves. We raised our right arm and we spoke, and our voice was the clearest, the steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The will of our brothers be done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their eyes were as cold blue glass buttons.&#013;&#013;So we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers. It is a grey house on a narrow street. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by which the Council of the Home can tell the hours of the day and when to ring the bell. When the bell rings, we all arise from our beds. The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east. The shadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and eat our breakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long tables with twenty clay plates and twenty clay cups on each table. Then we go to work in the streets of the City, with our brooms and our rakes. In five hours, when the sun is high, we return to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which one-half hour is allowed. Then we go to work again. In five hours, the shadows are blue on the pavements, and the sky is blue with a deep brightness which is not bright. We come back to have our dinner, which lasts one hour. Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social Meeting. Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the different Trades. The candles are lit, and the Councils of the different Homes stand in a pulpit, and they speak to us of our duties and of our brother men. Then visiting Leaders mount the pulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in the City Council that day, for the City Council represents all men and all men must know. Then we sing hymns, the Hymn of Brotherhood, and the Hymn of Equality, and the Hymn of the Collective Spirit. The sky is a soggy purple when we return to the Home. Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to the City Theatre for three hours of Social Recreation. There a play is shown upon the stage, with two great choruses from the Home of the Actors, which speak and answer all together, in two great voices. The plays are about toil and how good it is. Then we walk back to the Home in a straight column. The sky is like a black sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst through. The moths beat against the street lanterns. We go to our beds and we sleep, till the bell rings again. The sleeping halls are white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds.&#013;&#013;Thus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago when our crime happened. Thus must all men live until they are forty. At forty, they are worn out. At forty, they are sent to the Home of the Useless, where the Old Ones live. The Old Ones do not work, for the State takes care of them. They sit in the sun in summer and they sit by the fire in winter. They do not speak often, for they are weary. The Old Ones know that they are soon to die. When a miracle happens and some live to be forty-five, they are the Ancient Ones, and the children stare at them when passing by the Home of the Useless. Such is to be our life, as that of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us.&#013;&#013;Such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime which changed all things for us. And it was our curse which drove us to our crime. We had been a good Street Sweeper and like all our brother Street Sweepers, save for our cursed wish to know. We looked too long at the stars at night, and at the trees and the earth. And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of the Scholars, we gathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the dried bones which they had discarded. We wished to keep these things and to study them, but we had no place to hide them. So we carried them to the City Cesspool. And then we made the discovery.&#013;&#013;It was on a day of the spring before last. We Street Sweepers work in brigades of three, and we were with Union 5-3992, they of the half-brain, and with International 4-8818. Now Union 5-3992 are a sickly lad and sometimes they are stricken with convulsions, when their mouth froths and their eyes turn white. But International 4-8818 are different. They are a tall, strong youth and their eyes are like fireflies, for there is laughter in their eyes. We cannot look upon International 4-8818 and not smile in answer. For this they were not liked in the Home of the Students, as it is not proper to smile without reason. And also they were not liked because they took pieces of coal and they drew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made men laugh. But it is only our brothers in the Home of the Artists who are permitted to draw pictures, so International 4-8818 were sent to the Home of the Street Sweepers, like ourselves.&#013;&#013;International 4-8818 and we are friends. This is an evil thing to say, for it is a transgression, the great Transgression of Preference, to love any among men better than the others, since we must love all men and all men are our friends. So International 4-8818 and we have never spoken of it. But we know. We know, when we look into each other&#x2019;s eyes. And when we look thus without words, we both know other things also, strange things for which there are no words, and these things frighten us.&#013;&#013;So on that day of the spring before last, Union 5-3992 were stricken with convulsions on the edge of the City, near the City Theatre. We left them to lie in the shade of the Theatre tent and we went with International 4-8818 to finish our work. We came together to the great ravine behind the Theatre. It is empty save for trees and weeds. Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and beyond the plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men must not think.&#013;&#013;We were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had blown from the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds. It was old and rusted by many rains. We pulled with all our strength, but we could not move it. So we called International 4-8818, and together we scraped the earth around the bar. Of a sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill over a black hole.&#013;&#013;International 4-8818 stepped back. But we pulled at the grill and it gave way. And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a shaft into a darkness without bottom.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall go down,&#x201d; we said to International 4-8818.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is forbidden,&#x201d; they answered.&#013;&#013;We said: &#x201c;The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be forbidden.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And they answered: &#x201c;Since the Council does not know of this hole, there can be no law permitting to enter it. And everything which is not permitted by law is forbidden.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But we said: &#x201c;We shall go, none the less.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.&#013;&#013;We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet. We could see nothing below us. And above us the hole open upon the sky grew smaller and smaller, till it came to be the size of a button. But still we went down. Then our foot touched the ground. We rubbed our eyes, for we could not see. Then our eyes became used to the darkness, but we could not believe what we saw.&#013;&#013;No men known to us could have built this place, nor the men known to our brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men. It was a great tunnel. Its walls were hard and smooth to the touch; it felt like stone, but it was not stone. On the ground there were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it felt smooth and cold as glass. We knelt, and we crawled forward, our hand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead. But there was an unbroken night ahead. Only the iron tracks glowed through it, straight and white, calling us to follow. But we could not follow, for we were losing the puddle of light behind us. So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the iron line. And our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. And then we knew.&#013;&#013;We knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable Times. So it was true, and those Times had been, and all the wonders of those Times. Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men knew secrets which we have lost. And we thought: &#x201c;This is a foul place. They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable Times.&#x201d; But our hand which followed the track, as we crawled, clung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of our hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid beating in its coldness.&#013;&#013;We returned to the earth. International 4-8818 looked upon us and stepped back.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Equality 7-2521,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;your face is white.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But we could not speak and we stood looking upon them.&#013;&#013;They backed away, as if they dared not touch us. Then they smiled, but it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. But still we could not speak. Then they said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will be rewarded.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in our voice. We said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not report it to any men.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard such words as these.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;International 4-8818,&#x201d; we asked, &#x201c;will you report us to the Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: &#x201c;Rather would we die.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then,&#x201d; we said, &#x201c;keep silent. This place is ours. This place belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth. And if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it also.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we saw that the eyes of International 4-8818 were full to the lids with tears they dared not drop. They whispered, and their voice trembled, so that their words lost all shape:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will of our brothers, which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall obey you. Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our brothers. May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street Sweepers. And we walked in silence.&#013;&#013;Thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high and the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality 7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place. It is easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown out and the Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl under our seat and under the cloth of the tent. Later, it is easy to steal through the shadows and fall in line next to International 4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre. It is dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no men may walk through the City when they have no mission to walk there. Each night, we run to the ravine, and we remove the stones which we have piled upon the iron grill to hide it from the men. Each night, for three hours, we are under the earth, alone.&#013;&#013;We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we have stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them to this place. We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids from the Home of the Scholars. Now we sit in the tunnel for three hours each night and we study. We melt strange metals, and we mix acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in the City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we gathered in the streets. We burn the wood we find in the ravine. The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.&#013;&#013;We have stolen manuscripts. This is a great offense. Manuscripts are precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend one year to copy one single script in their clear handwriting. Manuscripts are rare and they are kept in the Home of the Scholars. So we sit under the earth and we read the stolen scripts. Two years have passed since we found this place. And in these two years we have learned more than we had learned in the ten years of the Home of the Students.&#013;&#013;We have learned things which are not in the scripts. We have solved secrets of which the Scholars have no knowledge. We have come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes will not bring us to the end of our quest. But we wish no end to our quest. We wish nothing, save to be alone and to learn, and to feel as if with each day our sight were growing sharper than the hawk&#x2019;s and clearer than rock crystal.&#013;&#013;Strange are the ways of evil. We are false in the faces of our brothers. We are defying the will of our Councils. We alone, of the thousands who walk this earth, we alone in this hour are doing a work which has no purpose save that we wish to do it. The evil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe. The nature of our punishment, if it be discovered, is not for the human heart to ponder. Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones&#x2019; Ancients, never have men done that which we are doing.&#013;&#013;And yet there is no shame in us and no regret. We say to ourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor. But we feel no burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart. And it seems to us that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save those of the sun. And in our heart&#x2014;strange are the ways of evil!&#x2014;in our heart there is the first peace we have known in twenty years.&#013;&#013;&#013;PART TWO&#013;Liberty 5-3000... Liberty five-three thousand ... Liberty 5-3000....&#013;&#013;We wish to write this name. We wish to speak it, but we dare not speak it above a whisper. For men are forbidden to take notice of women, and women are forbidden to take notice of men. But we think of one among women, they whose name is Liberty 5-3000, and we think of no others. The women who have been assigned to work the soil live in the Homes of the Peasants beyond the City. Where the City ends there is a great road winding off to the north, and we Street Sweepers must keep this road clean to the first milepost. There is a hedge along the road, and beyond the hedge lie the fields. The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie like a great fan before us, with their furrows gathered in some hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with thin, green spangles. Women work in the fields, and their white tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over the black soil.&#013;&#013;And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the furrows. Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron. Their eyes were dark and hard and glowing, with no fear in them, no kindness and no guilt. Their hair was golden as the sun; their hair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied men to restrain it. They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned to fling a scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their feet.&#013;&#013;We stood still; for the first time did we know fear, and then pain. And we stood still that we might not spill this pain more precious than pleasure.&#013;&#013;Then we heard a voice from the others call their name: &#x201c;Liberty 5-3000,&#x201d; and they turned and walked back. Thus we learned their name, and we stood watching them go, till their white tunic was lost in the blue mist.&#013;&#013;And the following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept our eyes upon Liberty 5-3000 in the field. And each day thereafter we knew the illness of waiting for our hour on the northern road. And there we looked at Liberty 5-3000 each day. We know not whether they looked at us also, but we think they did. Then one day they came close to the hedge, and suddenly they turned to us. They turned in a whirl and the movement of their body stopped, as if slashed off, as suddenly as it had started. They stood still as a stone, and they looked straight upon us, straight into our eyes. There was no smile on their face, and no welcome. But their face was taut, and their eyes were dark. Then they turned as swiftly, and they walked away from us.&#013;&#013;But the following day, when we came to the road, they smiled. They smiled to us and for us. And we smiled in answer. Their head fell back, and their arms fell, as if their arms and their thin white neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude. They were not looking upon us, but upon the sky. Then they glanced at us over their shoulder, as we felt as if a hand had touched our body, slipping softly from our lips to our feet.&#013;&#013;Every morning thereafter, we greeted each other with our eyes. We dared not speak. It is a transgression to speak to men of other Trades, save in groups at the Social Meetings. But once, standing at the hedge, we raised our hand to our forehead and then moved it slowly, palm down, toward Liberty 5-3000. Had the others seen it, they could have guessed nothing, for it looked only as if we were shading our eyes from the sun. But Liberty 5-3000 saw it and understood. They raised their hand to their forehead and moved it as we had. Thus, each day, we greet Liberty 5-3000, and they answer, and no men can suspect.&#013;&#013;We do not wonder at this new sin of ours. It is our second Transgression of Preference, for we do not think of all our brothers, as we must, but only of one, and their name is Liberty 5-3000. We do not know why we think of them. We do not know why, when we think of them, we feel all of a sudden that the earth is good and that it is not a burden to live. We do not think of them as Liberty 5-3000 any longer. We have given them a name in our thoughts. We call them the Golden One. But it is a sin to give men names which distinguish them from other men. Yet we call them the Golden One, for they are not like the others. The Golden One are not like the others.&#013;&#013;And we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think of women, save at the Time of Mating. This is the time each spring when all the men older than twenty and all the women older than eighteen are sent for one night to the City Palace of Mating. And each of the men have one of the women assigned to them by the Council of Eugenics. Children are born each winter, but women never see their children and children never know their parents. Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think.&#013;&#013;We had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more. Today, we spoke to the Golden One.&#013;&#013;The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge by the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone at the moat which runs through the field. And the drops of water falling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the Golden One saw us, and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in the air.&#013;&#013;Then the Golden One rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had heard a command in our eyes. The two other Street Sweepers of our brigade were a hundred paces away down the road. And we thought that International 4-8818 would not betray us, and Union 5-3992 would not understand. So we looked straight upon the Golden One, and we saw the shadows of their lashes on their white cheeks and the sparks of sun on their lips. And we said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Their face did not move and they did not avert their eyes. Only their eyes grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and it was not triumph over us, but over things we could not guess.&#013;&#013;Then they asked:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Equality 7-2521,&#x201d; we answered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are not one of our brothers, Equality 7-2521, for we do not wish you to be.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We cannot say what they meant, for there are no words for their meaning, but we know it without words and we knew it then.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; we answered, &#x201c;nor are you one of our sisters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall look upon you, Liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all the women of the earth.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then they asked:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are Street Sweepers sent to different parts of the City or do they always work in the same places?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They always work in the same places,&#x201d; we answered, &#x201c;and no one will take this road away from us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your eyes,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;are not like the eyes of any among men.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And suddenly, without cause for the thought which came to us, we felt cold, cold to our stomach.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; we asked.&#013;&#013;They understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the first time.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Seventeen,&#x201d; they whispered.&#013;&#013;And we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had been thinking without reason of the Palace of Mating. And we thought that we would not let the Golden One be sent to the Palace. How to prevent it, how to bar the will of the Councils, we knew not, but we knew suddenly that we would. Only we do not know why such thought came to us, for these ugly matters bear no relation to us and the Golden One. What relation can they bear?&#013;&#013;Still, without reason, as we stood there by the hedge, we felt our lips drawn tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our brother men. And the Golden One saw it and smiled slowly, and there was in their smile the first sadness we had seen in them. We think that in the wisdom of women the Golden One had understood more than we can understand.&#013;&#013;Then three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward the road, so the Golden One walked away from us. They took the bag of seeds, and they threw the seeds into the furrows of earth as they walked away. But the seeds flew wildly, for the hand of the Golden One was trembling.&#013;&#013;Yet as we walked back to the Home of the Street Sweepers, we felt that we wanted to sing, without reason. So we were reprimanded tonight, in the dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun to sing aloud some tune we had never heard. But it is not proper to sing without reason, save at the Social Meetings.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are singing because we are happy,&#x201d; we answered the one of the Home Council who reprimanded us.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Indeed you are happy,&#x201d; they answered. &#x201c;How else can men be when they live for their brothers?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about these words. It is forbidden, not to be happy. For, as it has been explained to us, men are free and the earth belongs to them; and all things on earth belong to all men; and the will of all men together is good for all; and so all men must be happy.&#013;&#013;Yet as we stand at night in the great hall, removing our garments for sleep, we look upon our brothers and we wonder. The heads of our brothers are bowed. The eyes of our brothers are dull, and never do they look one another in the eyes. The shoulders of our brothers are hunched, and their muscles are drawn, as if their bodies were shrinking and wished to shrink out of sight. And a word steals into our mind, as we look upon our brothers, and that word is fear.&#013;&#013;There is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and in the air of the streets. Fear walks through the City, fear without name, without shape. All men feel it and none dare to speak.&#013;&#013;We feel it also, when we are in the Home of the Street Sweepers. But here, in our tunnel, we feel it no longer. The air is pure under the ground. There is no odor of men. And these three hours give us strength for our hours above the ground.&#013;&#013;Our body is betraying us, for the Council of the Home looks with suspicion upon us. It is not good to feel too much joy nor to be glad that our body lives. For we matter not and it must not matter to us whether we live or die, which is to be as our brothers will it. But we, Equality 7-2521, are glad to be living. If this is a vice, then we wish no virtue.&#013;&#013;Yet our brothers are not like us. All is not well with our brothers. There are Fraternity 2-5503, a quiet boy with wise, kind eyes, who cry suddenly, without reason, in the midst of day or night, and their body shakes with sobs they cannot explain. There are Solidarity 9-6347, who are a bright youth, without fear in the day; but they scream in their sleep, and they scream: &#x201c;Help us! Help us! Help us!&#x201d; into the night, in a voice which chills our bones, but the Doctors cannot cure Solidarity 9-6347.&#013;&#013;And as we all undress at night, in the dim light of the candles, our brothers are silent, for they dare not speak the thoughts of their minds. For all must agree with all, and they cannot know if their thoughts are the thoughts of all, and so they fear to speak. And they are glad when the candles are blown for the night. But we, Equality 7-2521, look through the window upon the sky, and there is peace in the sky, and cleanliness, and dignity. And beyond the City there lies the plain, and beyond the plain, black upon the black sky, there lies the Uncharted Forest.&#013;&#013;We do not wish to look upon the Uncharted Forest. We do not wish to think of it. But ever do our eyes return to that black patch upon the sky. Men never enter the Uncharted Forest, for there is no power to explore it and no path to lead among its ancient trees which stand as guards of fearful secrets. It is whispered that once or twice in a hundred years, one among the men of the City escape alone and run to the Uncharted Forest, without call or reason. These men do not return. They perish from hunger and from the claws of the wild beasts which roam the Forest. But our Councils say that this is only a legend. We have heard that there are many Uncharted Forests over the land, among the Cities. And it is whispered that they have grown over the ruins of many cities of the Unmentionable Times. The trees have swallowed the ruins, and the bones under the ruins, and all the things which perished. And as we look upon the Uncharted Forest far in the night, we think of the secrets of the Unmentionable Times. And we wonder how it came to pass that these secrets were lost to the world. We have heard the legends of the great fighting, in which many men fought on one side and only a few on the other. These few were the Evil Ones and they were conquered. Then great fires raged over the land. And in these fires the Evil Ones and all the things made by the Evil Ones were burned. And the fire which is called the Dawn of the Great Rebirth, was the Script Fire where all the scripts of the Evil Ones were burned, and with them all the words of the Evil Ones. Great mountains of flame stood in the squares of the Cities for three months. Then came the Great Rebirth.&#013;&#013;The words of the Evil Ones... The words of the Unmentionable Times... What are the words which we have lost?&#013;&#013;May the Council have mercy upon us! We had no wish to write such a question, and we knew not what we were doing till we had written it. We shall not ask this question and we shall not think it. We shall not call death upon our head.&#013;&#013;And yet... And yet... There is some word, one single word which is not in the language of men, but which had been. And this is the Unspeakable Word, which no men may speak nor hear. But sometimes, and it is rare, sometimes, somewhere, one among men find that word. They find it upon scraps of old manuscripts or cut into the fragments of ancient stones. But when they speak it they are put to death. There is no crime punished by death in this world, save this one crime of speaking the Unspeakable Word.&#013;&#013;We have seen one of such men burned alive in the square of the City. And it was a sight which has stayed with us through the years, and it haunts us, and follows us, and it gives us no rest. We were a child then, ten years old. And we stood in the great square with all the children and all the men of the City, sent to behold the burning. They brought the Transgressor out into the square and they led them to the pyre. They had torn out the tongue of the Transgressor, so that they could speak no longer. The Transgressor were young and tall. They had hair of gold and eyes blue as morning. They walked to the pyre, and their step did not falter. And of all the faces on that square, of all the faces which shrieked and screamed and spat curses upon them, theirs was the calmest and the happiest face.&#013;&#013;As the chains were wound over their body at the stake, and a flame set to the pyre, the Transgressor looked upon the City. There was a thin thread of blood running from the corner of their mouth, but their lips were smiling. And a monstrous thought came to us then, which has never left us. We had heard of Saints. There are the Saints of Labor, and the Saints of the Councils, and the Saints of the Great Rebirth. But we had never seen a Saint nor what the likeness of a Saint should be. And we thought then, standing in the square, that the likeness of a Saint was the face we saw before us in the flames, the face of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word.&#013;&#013;As the flames rose, a thing happened which no eyes saw but ours, else we would not be living today. Perhaps it had only seemed to us. But it seemed to us that the eyes of the Transgressor had chosen us from the crowd and were looking straight upon us. There was no pain in their eyes and no knowledge of the agony of their body. There was only joy in them, and pride, a pride holier than is fit for human pride to be. And it seemed as if these eyes were trying to tell us something through the flames, to send into our eyes some word without sound. And it seemed as if these eyes were begging us to gather that word and not to let it go from us and from the earth. But the flames rose and we could not guess the word....&#013;&#013;What&#x2014;even if we have to burn for it like the Saint of the Pyre&#x2014;what is the Unspeakable Word?&#013;&#013;&#013;PART THREE&#013;We, Equality 7-2521, have discovered a new power of nature. And we have discovered it alone, and we alone are to know it.&#013;&#013;It is said. Now let us be lashed for it, if we must. The Council of Scholars has said that we all know the things which exist and therefore the things which are not known by all do not exist. But we think that the Council of Scholars is blind. The secrets of this earth are not for all men to see, but only for those who will seek them. We know, for we have found a secret unknown to all our brothers.&#013;&#013;We know not what this power is nor whence it comes. But we know its nature, we have watched it and worked with it. We saw it first two years ago. One night, we were cutting open the body of a dead frog when we saw its leg jerking. It was dead, yet it moved. Some power unknown to men was making it move. We could not understand it. Then, after many tests, we found the answer. The frog had been hanging on a wire of copper; and it had been the metal of our knife which had sent the strange power to the copper through the brine of the frog&#x2019;s body. We put a piece of copper and a piece of zinc into a jar of brine, we touched a wire to them, and there, under our fingers, was a miracle which had never occurred before, a new miracle and a new power.&#013;&#013;This discovery haunted us. We followed it in preference to all our studies. We worked with it, we tested it in more ways than we can describe, and each step was as another miracle unveiling before us. We came to know that we had found the greatest power on earth. For it defies all the laws known to men. It makes the needle move and turn on the compass which we stole from the Home of the Scholars; but we had been taught, when still a child, that the loadstone points to the north and that this is a law which nothing can change; yet our new power defies all laws. We found that it causes lightning, and never have men known what causes lightning. In thunderstorms, we raised a tall rod of iron by the side of our hole, and we watched it from below. We have seen the lightning strike it again and again. And now we know that metal draws the power of the sky, and that metal can be made to give it forth.&#013;&#013;We have built strange things with this discovery of ours. We used for it the copper wires which we found here under the ground. We have walked the length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the way. We could go no farther than half a mile, for earth and rock had fallen at both ends. But we gathered all the things we found and we brought them to our work place. We found strange boxes with bars of metal inside, with many cords and strands and coils of metal. We found wires that led to strange little globes of glass on the walls; they contained threads of metal thinner than a spider&#x2019;s web.&#013;&#013;These things help us in our work. We do not understand them, but we think that the men of the Unmentionable Times had known our power of the sky, and these things had some relation to it. We do not know, but we shall learn. We cannot stop now, even though it frightens us that we are alone in our knowledge.&#013;&#013;No single one can possess greater wisdom than the many Scholars who are elected by all men for their wisdom. Yet we can. We do. We have fought against saying it, but now it is said. We do not care. We forget all men, all laws and all things save our metals and our wires. So much is still to be learned! So long a road lies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone!&#013;&#013;&#013;PART FOUR&#013;Many days passed before we could speak to the Golden One again. But then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun had burst and spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay still without breath, and the dust of the road was white in the glow. So the women of the field were weary, and they tarried over their work, and they were far from the road when we came. But the Golden One stood alone at the hedge, waiting. We stopped and we saw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to the world, were looking at us as if they would obey any word we might speak.&#013;&#013;And we said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have given you a name in our thoughts, Liberty 5-3000.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is our name?&#x201d; they asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The Golden One.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nor do we call you Equality 7-2521 when we think of you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What name have you given us?&#x201d; They looked straight into our eyes and they held their head high and they answered:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The Unconquered.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For a long time we could not speak. Then we said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Such thoughts as these are forbidden, Golden One.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We looked into their eyes and we could not lie.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: &#x201c;Our dearest one, do not obey us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Speak these words again,&#x201d; they whispered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Which words?&#x201d; we asked. But they did not answer, and we knew it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our dearest one,&#x201d; we whispered.&#013;&#013;Never have men said this to women.&#013;&#013;The head of the Golden One bowed slowly, and they stood still before us, their arms at their sides, the palms of their hands turned to us, as if their body were delivered in submission to our eyes. And we could not speak.&#013;&#013;Then they raised their head, and they spoke simply and gently, as if they wished us to forget some anxiety of their own.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The day is hot,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;and you have worked for many hours and you must be weary.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; we answered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is cooler in the fields,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;and there is water to drink. Are you thirsty?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; we answered, &#x201c;but we cannot cross the hedge.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall bring the water to you,&#x201d; they said.&#013;&#013;Then they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two hands, they rose and they held the water out to our lips.&#013;&#013;We do not know if we drank that water. We only knew suddenly that their hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to their hands, and that they knew it, but did not move.&#013;&#013;We raised our head and stepped back. For we did not understand what had made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it.&#013;&#013;And the Golden One stepped back, and stood looking upon their hands in wonder. Then the Golden One moved away, even though no others were coming, and they moved, stepping back, as if they could not turn from us, their arms bent before them, as if they could not lower their hands.&#013;&#013;&#013;PART FIVE&#013;We made it. We created it. We brought it forth from the night of the ages. We alone. Our hands. Our mind. Ours alone and only.&#013;&#013;We know not what we are saying. Our head is reeling. We look upon the light which we have made. We shall be forgiven for anything we say tonight....&#013;&#013;Tonight, after more days and trials than we can count, we finished building a strange thing, from the remains of the Unmentionable Times, a box of glass, devised to give forth the power of the sky of greater strength than we had ever achieved before. And when we put our wires to this box, when we closed the current&#x2014;the wire glowed! It came to life, it turned red, and a circle of light lay on the stone before us.&#013;&#013;We stood, and we held our head in our hands. We could not conceive of that which we had created. We had touched no flint, made no fire. Yet here was light, light that came from nowhere, light from the heart of metal.&#013;&#013;We blew out the candle. Darkness swallowed us. There was nothing left around us, nothing save night and a thin thread of flame in it, as a crack in the wall of a prison. We stretched our hands to the wire, and we saw our fingers in the red glow. We could not see our body nor feel it, and in that moment nothing existed save our two hands over a wire glowing in a black abyss.&#013;&#013;Then we thought of the meaning of that which lay before us. We can light our tunnel, and the City, and all the Cities of the world with nothing save metal and wires. We can give our brothers a new light, cleaner and brighter than any they have ever known. The power of the sky can be made to do men&#x2019;s bidding. There are no limits to its secrets and its might, and it can be made to grant us anything if we but choose to ask.&#013;&#013;Then we knew what we must do. Our discovery is too great for us to waste our time in sweeping the streets. We must not keep our secret to ourselves, nor buried under the ground. We must bring it into the sight of all men. We need all our time, we need the work rooms of the Home of the Scholars, we want the help of our brother Scholars and their wisdom joined to ours. There is so much work ahead for all of us, for all the Scholars of the world.&#013;&#013;In a month, the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City. It is a great Council, to which the wisest of all lands are elected, and it meets once a year in the different Cities of the earth. We shall go to this Council and we shall lay before them, as our gift, this glass box with the power of the sky. We shall confess everything to them. They will see, understand and forgive. For our gift is greater than our transgression. They will explain it to the Council of Vocations, and we shall be assigned to the Home of the Scholars. This has never been done before, but neither has a gift such as ours ever been offered to men.&#013;&#013;We must wait. We must guard our tunnel as we had never guarded it before. For should any men save the Scholars learn of our secret, they would not understand it, nor would they believe us. They would see nothing, save our crime of working alone, and they would destroy us and our light. We care not about our body, but our light is...&#013;&#013;Yes, we do care. For the first time do we care about our body. For this wire is as a part of our body, as a vein torn from us, glowing with our blood. Are we proud of this thread of metal, or of our hands which made it, or is there a line to divide these two?&#013;&#013;We stretch out our arms. For the first time do we know how strong our arms are. And a strange thought comes to us: we wonder, for the first time in our life, what we look like. Men never see their own faces and never ask their brothers about it, for it is evil to have concern for their own faces or bodies. But tonight, for a reason we cannot fathom, we wish it were possible to us to know the likeness of our own person.&#013;&#013;&#013;PART SIX&#013;We have not written for thirty days. For thirty days we have not been here, in our tunnel. We had been caught. It happened on that night when we wrote last. We forgot, that night, to watch the sand in the glass which tells us when three hours have passed and it is time to return to the City Theatre. When we remembered it, the sand had run out.&#013;&#013;We hastened to the Theatre. But the big tent stood grey and silent against the sky. The streets of the City lay before us, dark and empty. If we went back to hide in our tunnel, we would be found and our light found with us. So we walked to the Home of the Street Sweepers.&#013;&#013;When the Council of the Home questioned us, we looked upon the faces of the Council, but there was no curiosity in those faces, and no anger, and no mercy. So when the oldest of them asked us: &#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; we thought of our glass box and of our light, and we forgot all else. And we answered:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We will not tell you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The oldest did not question us further. They turned to the two youngest, and said, and their voice was bored:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Take our brother Equality 7-2521 to the Palace of Corrective Detention. Lash them until they tell.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So we were taken to the Stone Room under the Palace of Corrective Detention. This room has no windows and it is empty save for an iron post. Two men stood by the post, naked but for leather aprons and leather hoods over their faces. Those who had brought us departed, leaving us to the two Judges who stood in a corner of the room. The Judges were small, thin men, grey and bent. They gave the signal to the two strong hooded ones.&#013;&#013;They tore the clothes from our body, they threw us down upon our knees and they tied our hands to the iron post. The first blow of the lash felt as if our spine had been cut in two. The second blow stopped the first, and for a second we felt nothing, then the pain struck us in our throat and fire ran in our lungs without air. But we did not cry out.&#013;&#013;The lash whistled like a singing wind. We tried to count the blows, but we lost count. We knew that the blows were falling upon our back. Only we felt nothing upon our back any longer. A flaming grill kept dancing before our eyes, and we thought of nothing save that grill, a grill, a grill of red squares, and then we knew that we were looking at the squares of the iron grill in the door, and there were also the squares of stone on the walls, and the squares which the lash was cutting upon our back, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh.&#013;&#013;Then we saw a fist before us. It knocked our chin up, and we saw the red froth of our mouth on the withered fingers, and the Judge asked:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But we jerked our head away, hid our face upon our tied hands, and bit our lips.&#013;&#013;The lash whistled again. We wondered who was sprinkling burning coal dust upon the floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on the stones around us.&#013;&#013;Then we knew nothing, save two voices snarling steadily, one after the other, even though we knew they were speaking many minutes apart:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where have you been where have you been where have you been where have you been?...&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And our lips moved, but the sound trickled back into our throat, and the sound was only:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The light... The light... The light....&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we knew nothing.&#013;&#013;We opened our eyes, lying on our stomach on the brick floor of a cell. We looked upon two hands lying far before us on the bricks, and we moved them, and we knew that they were our hands. But we could not move our body. Then we smiled, for we thought of the light and that we had not betrayed it.&#013;&#013;We lay in our cell for many days. The door opened twice each day, once for the men who brought us bread and water, and once for the Judges. Many Judges came to our cell, first the humblest and then the most honored Judges of the City. They stood before us in their white togas, and they asked:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you ready to speak?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But we shook our head, lying before them on the floor. And they departed.&#013;&#013;We counted each day and each night as it passed. Then, tonight, we knew that we must escape. For tomorrow the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City.&#013;&#013;It was easy to escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention. The locks are old on the doors and there are no guards about. There is no reason to have guards, for men have never defied the Councils so far as to escape from whatever place they were ordered to be. Our body is healthy and strength returns to it speedily. We lunged against the door and it gave way. We stole through the dark passages, and through the dark streets, and down into our tunnel.&#013;&#013;We lit the candle and we saw that our place had not been found and nothing had been touched. And our glass box stood before us on the cold oven, as we had left it. What matter they now, the scars upon our back!&#013;&#013;Tomorrow, in the full light of day, we shall take our box, and leave our tunnel open, and walk through the streets to the Home of the Scholars. We shall put before them the greatest gift ever offered to men. We shall tell them the truth. We shall hand to them, as our confession, these pages we have written. We shall join our hands to theirs, and we shall work together, with the power of the sky, for the glory of mankind. Our blessing upon you, our brothers! Tomorrow, you will take us back into your fold and we shall be an outcast no longer. Tomorrow we shall be one of you again. Tomorrow...&#013;&#013;&#013;PART SEVEN&#013;It is dark here in the forest. The leaves rustle over our head, black against the last gold of the sky. The moss is soft and warm. We shall sleep on this moss for many nights, till the beasts of the forest come to tear our body. We have no bed now, save the moss, and no future, save the beasts.&#013;&#013;We are old now, yet we were young this morning, when we carried our glass box through the streets of the City to the Home of the Scholars. No men stopped us, for there were none about from the Palace of Corrective Detention, and the others knew nothing. No men stopped us at the gate. We walked through empty passages and into the great hall where the World Council of Scholars sat in solemn meeting.&#013;&#013;We saw nothing as we entered, save the sky in the great windows, blue and glowing. Then we saw the Scholars who sat around a long table; they were as shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of the great sky. There were men whose famous names we knew, and others from distant lands whose names we had not heard. We saw a great painting on the wall over their heads, of the twenty illustrious men who had invented the candle.&#013;&#013;All the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered. These great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us, and they looked upon us with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a miracle. It is true that our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood. We raised our right arm and we said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council of Scholars!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council, spoke and asked:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are you, our brother? For you do not look like a Scholar.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our name is Equality 7-2521,&#x201d; we answered, &#x201c;and we are a Street Sweeper of this City.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the Scholars spoke at once, and they were angry and frightened.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A Street Sweeper! A Street Sweeper walking in upon the World Council of Scholars! It is not to be believed! It is against all the rules and all the laws!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But we knew how to stop them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our brothers!&#x201d; we said. &#x201c;We matter not, nor our transgression. It is only our brother men who matter. Give no thought to us, for we are nothing, but listen to our words, for we bring you a gift such as had never been brought to men. Listen to us, for we hold the future of mankind in our hands.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then they listened.&#013;&#013;We placed our glass box upon the table before them. We spoke of it, and of our long quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention. Not a hand moved in that hall, as we spoke, nor an eye. Then we put the wires to the box, and they all bent forward and sat still, watching. And we stood still, our eyes upon the wire. And slowly, slowly as a flush of blood, a red flame trembled in the wire. Then the wire glowed.&#013;&#013;But terror struck the men of the Council. They leapt to their feet, they ran from the table, and they stood pressed against the wall, huddled together, seeking the warmth of one another&#x2019;s bodies to give them courage.&#013;&#013;We looked upon them and we laughed and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Fear nothing, our brothers. There is a great power in these wires, but this power is tamed. It is yours. We give it to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Still they would not move.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We give you the power of the sky!&#x201d; we cried. &#x201c;We give you the key to the earth! Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest among you. Let us all work together, and harness this power, and make it ease the toil of men. Let us throw away our candles and our torches. Let us flood our cities with light. Let us bring a new light to men!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But they looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid. For their eyes were still, and small, and evil.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our brothers!&#x201d; we cried. &#x201c;Have you nothing to say to us?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Collective 0-0009 moved forward. They moved to the table and the others followed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; spoke Collective 0-0009, &#x201c;we have much to say to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The sound of their voices brought silence to the hall and to beat of our heart.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Collective 0-0009, &#x201c;we have much to say to a wretch who have broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How dared you think that your mind held greater wisdom than the minds of your brothers? And if the Councils had decreed that you should be a Street Sweeper, how dared you think that you could be of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How dared you, gutter cleaner,&#x201d; spoke Fraternity 9-3452, &#x201c;to hold yourself as one alone and with the thoughts of the one and not of the many?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You shall be burned at the stake,&#x201d; said Democracy 4-6998.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, they shall be lashed,&#x201d; said Unanimity 7-3304, &#x201c;till there is nothing left under the lashes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Collective 0-0009, &#x201c;we cannot decide upon this, our brothers. No such crime has ever been committed, and it is not for us to judge. Nor for any small Council. We shall deliver this creature to the World Council itself and let their will be done.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We looked upon them and we pleaded:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our brothers! You are right. Let the will of the Council be done upon our body. We do not care. But the light? What will you do with the light?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Collective 0-0009 looked upon us, and they smiled.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So you think that you have found a new power,&#x201d; said Collective 0-0009. &#x201c;Do all your brothers think that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; we answered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is not thought by all men cannot be true,&#x201d; said Collective 0-0009.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have worked on this alone?&#x201d; asked International 1-5537.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Many men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new ideas in the past,&#x201d; said Solidarity 8-1164, &#x201c;but when the majority of their brother Scholars voted against them, they abandoned their ideas, as all men must.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This box is useless,&#x201d; said Alliance 6-7349.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Should it be what they claim of it,&#x201d; said Harmony 9-2642, &#x201c;then it would bring ruin to the Department of Candles. The Candle is a great boon to mankind, as approved by all men. Therefore it cannot be destroyed by the whim of one.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This would wreck the Plans of the World Council,&#x201d; said Unanimity 2-9913, &#x201c;and without the Plans of the World Council the sun cannot rise. It took fifty years to secure the approval of all the Councils for the Candle, and to decide upon the number needed, and to re-fit the Plans so as to make candles instead of torches. This touched upon thousands and thousands of men working in scores of States. We cannot alter the Plans again so soon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And if this should lighten the toil of men,&#x201d; said Similarity 5-0306, &#x201c;then it is a great evil, for men have no cause to exist save in toiling for other men.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This thing,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;must be destroyed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And all the others cried as one:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It must be destroyed!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we leapt to the table.&#013;&#013;We seized our box, we shoved them aside, and we ran to the window. We turned and we looked at them for the last time, and a rage, such as it is not fit for humans to know, choked our voice in our throat.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You fools!&#x201d; we cried. &#x201c;You fools! You thrice-damned fools!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We swung our fist through the windowpane, and we leapt out in a ringing rain of glass.&#013;&#013;We fell, but we never let the box fall from our hands. Then we ran. We ran blindly, and men and houses streaked past us in a torrent without shape. And the road seemed not to be flat before us, but as if it were leaping up to meet us, and we waited for the earth to rise and strike us in the face. But we ran. We knew not where we were going. We knew only that we must run, run to the end of the world, to the end of our days.&#013;&#013;Then we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that we had stopped. Trees taller than we had ever seen before stood over us in great silence. Then we knew. We were in the Uncharted Forest. We had not thought of coming here, but our legs had carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought us to the Uncharted Forest against our will.&#013;&#013;Our glass box lay beside us. We crawled to it, we fell upon it, our face in our arms, and we lay still.&#013;&#013;We lay thus for a long time. Then we rose, we took our box and walked on into the forest.&#013;&#013;It mattered not where we went. We knew that men would not follow us, for they never enter the Uncharted Forest. We had nothing to fear from them. The forest disposes of its own victims. This gave us no fear either. Only we wished to be away, away from the City and from the air that touches upon the air of the City. So we walked on, our box in our arms, our heart empty.&#013;&#013;We are doomed. Whatever days are left to us, we shall spend them alone. And we have heard of the corruption to be found in solitude. We have torn ourselves from the truth which is our brother men, and there is no road back for us, and no redemption.&#013;&#013;We know these things, but we do not care. We care for nothing on earth. We are tired.&#013;&#013;Only the glass box in our arms is like a living heart that gives us strength. We have lied to ourselves. We have not built this box for the good of our brothers. We built it for its own sake. It is above all our brothers to us, and its truth above their truth. Why wonder about this? We have not many days to live. We are walking to the fangs awaiting us somewhere among the great, silent trees. There is not a thing behind us to regret.&#013;&#013;Then a blow of pain struck us, our first and our only. We thought of the Golden One. We thought of the Golden One whom we shall never see again. Then the pain passed. It is best. We are one of the Damned. It is best if the Golden One forget our name and the body which bore that name.&#013;&#013;&#013;PART EIGHT&#013;It has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in the forest.&#013;&#013;We awoke when a ray of sunlight fell across our face. We wanted to leap to our feet, as we have had to leap every morning of our life, but we remembered suddenly that no bell had rung and that there was no bell to ring anywhere. We lay on our back, we threw our arms out, and we looked up at the sky. The leaves had edges of silver that trembled and rippled like a river of green and fire flowing high above us.&#013;&#013;We did not wish to move. We thought suddenly that we could lie thus as long as we wished, and we laughed aloud at the thought. We could also rise, or run, or leap, or fall down again. We were thinking that these were thoughts without sense, but before we knew it our body had risen in one leap. Our arms stretched out of their own will, and our body whirled and whirled, till it raised a wind to rustle through the leaves of the bushes. Then our hands seized a branch and swung us high into a tree, with no aim save the wonder of learning the strength of our body. The branch snapped under us and we fell upon the moss that was soft as a cushion. Then our body, losing all sense, rolled over and over on the moss, dry leaves in our tunic, in our hair, in our face. And we heard suddenly that we were laughing, laughing aloud, laughing as if there were no power left in us save laughter.&#013;&#013;Then we took our glass box, and we went on into the forest. We went on, cutting through the branches, and it was as if we were swimming through a sea of leaves, with the bushes as waves rising and falling and rising around us, and flinging their green sprays high to the treetops. The trees parted before us, calling us forward. The forest seemed to welcome us. We went on, without thought, without care, with nothing to feel save the song of our body.&#013;&#013;We stopped when we felt hunger. We saw birds in the tree branches, and flying from under our footsteps. We picked a stone and we sent it as an arrow at a bird. It fell before us. We made a fire, we cooked the bird, and we ate it, and no meal had ever tasted better to us. And we thought suddenly that there was a great satisfaction to be found in the food which we need and obtain by our own hand. And we wished to be hungry again and soon, that we might know again this strange new pride in eating.&#013;&#013;Then we walked on. And we came to a stream which lay as a streak of glass among the trees. It lay so still that we saw no water but only a cut in the earth, in which the trees grew down, upturned, and the sky lay at the bottom. We knelt by the stream and we bent down to drink. And then we stopped. For, upon the blue of the sky below us, we saw our own face for the first time.&#013;&#013;We sat still and we held our breath. For our face and our body were beautiful. Our face was not like the faces of our brothers, for we felt not pity when looking upon it. Our body was not like the bodies of our brothers, for our limbs were straight and thin and hard and strong. And we thought that we could trust this being who looked upon us from the stream, and that we had nothing to fear with this being.&#013;&#013;We walked on till the sun had set. When the shadows gathered among the trees, we stopped in a hollow between the roots, where we shall sleep tonight. And suddenly, for the first time this day, we remembered that we are the Damned. We remembered it, and we laughed.&#013;&#013;We are writing this on the paper we had hidden in our tunic together with the written pages we had brought for the World Council of Scholars, but never given to them. We have much to speak of to ourselves, and we hope we shall find the words for it in the days to come. Now, we cannot speak, for we cannot understand.&#013;&#013;&#013;PART NINE&#013;We have not written for many days. We did not wish to speak. For we needed no words to remember that which has happened to us.&#013;&#013;It was on our second day in the forest that we heard steps behind us. We hid in the bushes, and we waited. The steps came closer. And then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold.&#013;&#013;We leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the Golden One.&#013;&#013;They saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists pulled their arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold them, while their body swayed. And they could not speak.&#013;&#013;We dared not come too close to them. We asked, and our voice trembled:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How did you come to be here, Golden One?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But they whispered only:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have found you....&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How did you come to be in the forest?&#x201d; we asked.&#013;&#013;They raised their head, and there was a great pride in their voice; they answered:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have followed you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we could not speak, and they said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We heard that you had gone to the Uncharted Forest, for the whole City is speaking of it. So on the night of the day when we heard it, we ran away from the Home of the Peasants. We found the marks of your feet across the plain where no men walk. So we followed them, and we went into the forest, and we followed the path where the branches were broken by your body.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Their white tunic was torn, and the branches had cut the skin of their arms, but they spoke as if they had never taken notice of it, nor of weariness, nor of fear.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We have followed you,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;and we shall follow you wherever you go. If danger threatens you, we shall face it also. If it be death, we shall die with you. You are damned, and we wish to share your damnation.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They looked upon us, and their voice was low, but there was bitterness and triumph in their voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your eyes are as a flame, but our brothers have neither hope nor fire. Your mouth is cut of granite, but our brothers are soft and humble. Your head is high, but our brothers cringe. You walk, but our brothers crawl. We wish to be damned with you, rather than blessed with all our brothers. Do as you please with us, but do not send us away from you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us.&#013;&#013;We had never thought of that which we did. We bent to raise the Golden One to their feet, but when we touched them, it was as if madness had stricken us. We seized their body and we pressed our lips to theirs. The Golden One breathed once, and their breath was a moan, and then their arms closed around us.&#013;&#013;We stood together for a long time. And we were frightened that we had lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is possible to men.&#013;&#013;Then we said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger in solitude. We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their good and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are together and that there is joy as a bond between us. Give us your hand. Look ahead. It is our own world, Golden One, a strange, unknown world, but our own.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours.&#013;&#013;And that night we knew that to hold the body of women in our arms is neither ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to the race of men.&#013;&#013;We have walked for many days. The forest has no end, and we seek no end. But each day added to the chain of days between us and the City is like an added blessing.&#013;&#013;We have made a bow and many arrows. We can kill more birds than we need for our food; we find water and fruit in the forest. At night, we choose a clearing, and we build a ring of fires around it. We sleep in the midst of that ring, and the beasts dare not attack us. We can see their eyes, green and yellow as coals, watching us from the tree branches beyond. The fires smoulder as a crown of jewels around us, and smoke stands still in the air, in columns made blue by the moonlight. We sleep together in the midst of the ring, the arms of the Golden One around us, their head upon our breast.&#013;&#013;Some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have gone far enough. But we do not have to hasten. The days before us are without end, like the forest.&#013;&#013;We cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it seems so clear and so simple. When questions come to puzzle us, we walk faster, then turn and forget all things as we watch the Golden One following. The shadows of leaves fall upon their arms, as they spread the branches apart, but their shoulders are in the sun. The skin of their arms is like a blue mist, but their shoulders are white and glowing, as if the light fell not from above, but rose from under their skin. We watch the leaf which has fallen upon their shoulder, and it lies at the curve of their neck, and a drop of dew glistens upon it like a jewel. They approach us, and they stop, laughing, knowing what we think, and they wait obediently, without questions, till it pleases us to turn and go on.&#013;&#013;We go on and we bless the earth under our feet. But questions come to us again, as we walk in silence. If that which we have found is the corruption of solitude, then what can men wish for save corruption? If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil?&#013;&#013;Everything which comes from the many is good. Everything which comes from one is evil. This have we been taught with our first breath. We have broken the law, but we have never doubted it. Yet now, as we walk through the forest, we are learning to doubt.&#013;&#013;There is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of all their brothers. But we lived not, when we toiled for our brothers, we were only weary. There is no joy for men, save the joy shared with all their brothers. But the only things which taught us joy were the power we created in our wires, and the Golden One. And both these joys belong to us alone, they come from us alone, they bear no relation to all our brothers, and they do not concern our brothers in any way. Thus do we wonder.&#013;&#013;There is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men. What is that error? We do not know, but the knowledge struggles within us, struggles to be born. Today, the Golden One stopped suddenly and said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We love you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But they frowned and shook their head and looked at us helplessly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; they whispered, &#x201c;that is not what we wished to say.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were halting, like the words of a child learning to speak for the first time:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are one... alone... and only... and we love you who are one... alone... and only.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;We looked into each other&#x2019;s eyes and we knew that the breath of a miracle had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly.&#013;&#013;And we felt torn, torn for some word we could not find.&#013;&#013;&#013;PART TEN&#013;We are sitting at a table and we are writing this upon paper made thousands of years ago. The light is dim, and we cannot see the Golden One, only one lock of gold on the pillow of an ancient bed. This is our home.&#013;&#013;We came upon it today, at sunrise. For many days we had been crossing a chain of mountains. The forest rose among cliffs, and whenever we walked out upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great peaks before us in the west, and to the north of us, and to the south, as far as our eyes could see. The peaks were red and brown, with the green streaks of forests as veins upon them, with blue mists as veils over their heads. We had never heard of these mountains, nor seen them marked on any map. The Uncharted Forest has protected them from the Cities and from the men of the Cities.&#013;&#013;We climbed paths where the wild goat dared not follow. Stones rolled from under our feet, and we heard them striking the rocks below, farther and farther down, and the mountains rang with each stroke, and long after the strokes had died. But we went on, for we knew that no men would ever follow our track nor reach us here.&#013;&#013;Then today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees, high on a sheer peak before us. We thought that it was a fire and stopped. But the flame was unmoving, yet blinding as liquid metal. So we climbed toward it through the rocks. And there, before us, on a broad summit, with the mountains rising behind it, stood a house such as we had never seen, and the white fire came from the sun on the glass of its windows.&#013;&#013;The house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor. There was more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows went on straight around the corners, though how this kept the house standing we could not guess. The walls were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which we had seen in our tunnel.&#013;&#013;We both knew it without words: this house was left from the Unmentionable Times. The trees had protected it from time and weather, and from men who have less pity than time and weather. We turned to the Golden One and we asked:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you afraid?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But they shook their head. So we walked to the door, and we threw it open, and we stepped together into the house of the Unmentionable Times.&#013;&#013;We shall need the days and the years ahead, to look, to learn, and to understand the things of this house. Today, we could only look and try to believe the sight of our eyes. We pulled the heavy curtains from the windows and we saw that the rooms were small, and we thought that not more than twelve men could have lived here. We thought it strange that men had been permitted to build a house for only twelve.&#013;&#013;Never had we seen rooms so full of light. The sunrays danced upon colors, colors, more colors than we thought possible, we who had seen no houses save the white ones, the brown ones and the grey. There were great pieces of glass on the walls, but it was not glass, for when we looked upon it we saw our own bodies and all the things behind us, as on the face of a lake. There were strange things which we had never seen and the use of which we do not know. And there were globes of glass everywhere, in each room, the globes with the metal cobwebs inside, such as we had seen in our tunnel.&#013;&#013;We found the sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its threshold. For it was a small room and there were only two beds in it. We found no other beds in the house, and then we knew that only two had lived here, and this passes understanding. What kind of world did they have, the men of the Unmentionable Times?&#013;&#013;We found garments, and the Golden One gasped at the sight of them. For they were not white tunics, nor white togas; they were of all colors, no two of them alike. Some crumbled to dust as we touched them. But others were of heavier cloth, and they felt soft and new in our fingers.&#013;&#013;We found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of manuscripts, from the floor to the ceiling. Never had we seen such a number of them, nor of such strange shape. They were not soft and rolled, they had hard shells of cloth and leather; and the letters on their pages were so small and so even that we wondered at the men who had such handwriting. We glanced through the pages, and we saw that they were written in our language, but we found many words which we could not understand. Tomorrow, we shall begin to read these scripts.&#013;&#013;When we had seen all the rooms of the house, we looked at the Golden One and we both knew the thought in our minds.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shall never leave this house,&#x201d; we said, &#x201c;nor let it be taken from us. This is our home and the end of our journey. This is your house, Golden One, and ours, and it belongs to no other men whatever as far as the earth may stretch. We shall not share it with others, as we share not our joy with them, nor our love, nor our hunger. So be it to the end of our days.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Your will be done,&#x201d; they said.&#013;&#013;Then we went out to gather wood for the great hearth of our home. We brought water from the stream which runs among the trees under our windows. We killed a mountain goat, and we brought its flesh to be cooked in a strange copper pot we found in a place of wonders, which must have been the cooking room of the house.&#013;&#013;We did this work alone, for no words of ours could take the Golden One away from the big glass which is not glass. They stood before it and they looked and looked upon their own body.&#013;&#013;When the sun sank beyond the mountains, the Golden One fell asleep on the floor, amidst jewels, and bottles of crystal, and flowers of silk. We lifted the Golden One in our arms and we carried them to a bed, their head falling softly upon our shoulder. Then we lit a candle, and we brought paper from the room of the manuscripts, and we sat by the window, for we knew that we could not sleep tonight.&#013;&#013;And now we look upon the earth and sky. This spread of naked rock and peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born, a world that waits. It seems to us it asks a sign from us, a spark, a first commandment. We cannot know what word we are to give, nor what great deed this earth expects to witness. We know it waits. It seems to say it has great gifts to lay before us, but it wishes a greater gift for us. We are to speak. We are to give its goal, its highest meaning to all this glowing space of rock and sky.&#013;&#013;We look ahead, we beg our heart for guidance in answering this call no voice has spoken, yet we have heard. We look upon our hands. We see the dust of centuries, the dust which hid the great secrets and perhaps great evils. And yet it stirs no fear within our heart, but only silent reverence and pity.&#013;&#013;May knowledge come to us! What is the secret our heart has understood and yet will not reveal to us, although it seems to beat as if it were endeavoring to tell it?&#013;&#013;&#013;PART ELEVEN&#013;I am. I think. I will.&#013;&#013;My hands... My spirit... My sky... My forest... This earth of mine.... What must I say besides? These are the words. This is the answer.&#013;&#013;I stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head and I spread my arms. This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest. I wished to know the meaning of things. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being. I need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the warrant and the sanction.&#013;&#013;It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. It is my mind which thinks, and the judgement of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.&#013;&#013;Many words have been granted me, and some are wise, and some are false, but only three are holy: &#x201c;I will it!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Whatever road I take, the guiding star is within me; the guiding star and the loadstone which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to me.&#013;&#013;I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.&#013;&#013;Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars.&#013;&#013;I am a man. This miracle of me is mine to own and keep, and mine to guard, and mine to use, and mine to kneel before!&#013;&#013;I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them. The fortune of my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to the winds as alms for the poor of the spirit. I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom.&#013;&#013;I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no man&#x2019;s soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet.&#013;&#013;I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall deserve of me. And to earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have been born. I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honor is a thing to be earned.&#013;&#013;I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters. And I shall choose only such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither command nor obey. And we shall join our hands when we wish, or walk alone when we so desire. For in the temple of his spirit, each man is alone. Let each man keep his temple untouched and undefiled. Then let him join hands with others if he wishes, but only beyond his holy threshold.&#013;&#013;For the word &#x201c;We&#x201d; must never be spoken, save by one&#x2019;s choice and as a second thought. This word must never be placed first within man&#x2019;s soul, else it becomes a monster, the root of all the evils on earth, the root of man&#x2019;s torture by men, and of an unspeakable lie.&#013;&#013;The word &#x201c;We&#x201d; is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black are lost equally in the grey of it. It is the word by which the depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which the weak steal the might of the strong, by which the fools steal the wisdom of the sages.&#013;&#013;What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it? What is my wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me? What is my freedom, if all creatures, even the botched and the impotent, are my masters? What is my life, if I am but to bow, to agree and to obey?&#013;&#013;But I am done with this creed of corruption.&#013;&#013;I am done with the monster of &#x201c;We,&#x201d; the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood and shame.&#013;&#013;And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride.&#013;&#013;This god, this one word:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;PART TWELVE&#013;It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house that I saw the word &#x201c;I.&#x201d; And when I understood this word, the book fell from my hands, and I wept, I who had never known tears. I wept in deliverance and in pity for all mankind.&#013;&#013;I understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse. I understood why the best in me had been my sins and my transgressions; and why I had never felt guilt in my sins. I understood that centuries of chains and lashes will not kill the spirit of man nor the sense of truth within him.&#013;&#013;I read many books for many days. Then I called the Golden One, and I told her what I had read and what I had learned. She looked at me and the first words she spoke were:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I love you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then I said:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names. There was a time when each man had a name of his own to distinguish him from all other men. So let us choose our names. I have read of a man who lived many thousands of years ago, and of all the names in these books, his is the one I wish to bear. He took the light of the gods and he brought it to men, and he taught men to be gods. And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of light must suffer. His name was Prometheus.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It shall be your name,&#x201d; said the Golden One.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And I have read of a goddess,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;who was the mother of the earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. Let this be your name, my Golden One, for you are to be the mother of a new kind of gods.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It shall be my name,&#x201d; said the Golden One.&#013;&#013;Now I look ahead. My future is clear before me. The Saint of the pyre had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the heir of all the saints and all the martyrs who came before him and who died for the same cause, for the same word, no matter what name they gave to their cause and their truth.&#013;&#013;I shall live here, in my own house. I shall take my food from the earth by the toil of my own hands. I shall learn many secrets from my books. Through the years ahead, I shall rebuild the achievements of the past, and open the way to carry them further, the achievements which are open to me, but closed forever to my brothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest ones among them.&#013;&#013;I have learned that my power of the sky was known to men long ago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved their greatest inventions. It lit this house with light which came from those globes of glass on the walls. I have found the engine which produced this light. I shall learn how to repair it and how to make it work again. I shall learn how to use the wires which carry this power. Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my home, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light as a cobweb, more impassable than a wall of granite; a barrier my brothers will never be able to cross. For they have nothing to fight me with, save the brute force of their numbers. I have my mind.&#013;&#013;Then here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and nothing above me but the sun, I shall live my own truth. Gaea is pregnant with my child. Our son will be raised as a man. He will be taught to say &#x201c;I&#x201d; and to bear the pride of it. He will be taught to walk straight and on his own feet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit.&#013;&#013;When I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when my home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day, for the last time, into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call to me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and all those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347 who calls for help in the night, and a few others. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit has not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of their brothers. They will follow me and I shall lead them to my fortress. And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my chosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter in the new history of man.&#013;&#013;These are the things before me. And as I stand here at the door of glory, I look behind me for the last time. I look upon the history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I wonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was the spirit of man&#x2019;s freedom. But what is freedom? Freedom from what? There is nothing to take a man&#x2019;s freedom away from him, save other men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers. That is freedom. That and nothing else.&#013;&#013;At first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their chains. Then he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their chains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race. But he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a man has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take away from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right of man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he stood on the threshold of the freedom for which the blood of the centuries behind him had been spilled.&#013;&#013;But then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his savage beginning.&#013;&#013;What brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away from men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and submission? The worship of the word &#x201c;We.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;When men accepted that worship, the structure of centuries collapsed about them, the structure whose every beam had come from the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages, from the depth of some one spirit, such spirit as existed but for its own sake. Those men who survived those eager to obey, eager to live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate them&#x2014;those men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they had received. Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom perish on earth. Thus did men&#x2014;men with nothing to offer save their great number&#x2014;lost the steel towers, the flying ships, the power wires, all the things they had not created and could never keep. Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and the courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps these men came before the Councils of Scholars. They were answered as I have been answered&#x2014;and for the same reasons.&#013;&#013;But I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years of transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were going, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate. I wonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word &#x201c;I&#x201d; could give it up and not know what they lost. But such has been the story, for I have lived in the City of the damned, and I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them.&#013;&#013;Perhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of clear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word. What agony must have been theirs before that which they saw coming and could not stop! Perhaps they cried out in protest and in warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. And they, these few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their banners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for they knew. To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.&#013;&#013;Theirs is the banner in my hand. And I wish I had the power to tell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final, and their night was not without hope. For the battle they lost can never be lost. For that which they died to save can never perish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which men are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this earth. It may sleep, but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but it will break through. And man will go on. Man, not men.&#013;&#013;Here on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall build our new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart of the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating louder each day. And word of it will reach every corner of the earth. And the roads of the world will become as veins which will carry the best of the world&#x2019;s blood to my threshold. And all my brothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but they will be impotent against me. And the day will come when I shall break all the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the enslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where each man will be free to exist for his own sake.&#013;&#013;For the coming of that day shall I fight, I and my sons and my chosen friends. For the freedom of Man. For his rights. For his life. For his honor.&#013;&#013;And here, over the portals of my fort, I shall cut in the stone the word which is to be my beacon and my banner. The word which will not die, should we all perish in battle. The word which can never die on this earth, for it is the heart of it and the meaning and the glory.&#013;&#013;The sacred word:&#013;&#013;EGO",

        "content": "I&#013;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.&#013;&#013;&quot;What's happened to me?&quot; he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.&#013;&#013;Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. &quot;How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense&quot;, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.&#013;&#013;&quot;Oh, God&quot;, he thought, &quot;what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!&quot; He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.&#013;&#013;He slid back into his former position. &quot;Getting up early all the time&quot;, he thought, &quot;it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five.&quot;&#013;&#013;And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. &quot;God in Heaven!&quot; he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.&#013;&#013;He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. &quot;Gregor&quot;, somebody called - it was his mother - &quot;it's quarter to seven. Didn't you want to go somewhere?&quot; That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: &quot;Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up now.&quot; The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. &quot;Gregor, Gregor&quot;, he called, &quot;what's wrong?&quot; And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: &quot;Gregor! Gregor!&quot; At the other side door his sister came plaintively: &quot;Gregor? Aren't you well? Do you need anything?&quot; Gregor answered to both sides: &quot;I'm ready, now&quot;, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: &quot;Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.&quot; Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.&#013;&#013;The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.&#013;&#013;It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. &quot;This is something that can't be done in bed&quot;, Gregor said to himself, &quot;so don't keep trying to do it&quot;.&#013;&#013;The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.&#013;&#013;So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.&#013;&#013;It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. &quot;Seven o'clock, already&quot;, he said to himself when the clock struck again, &quot;seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this.&quot; And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.&#013;&#013;But then he said to himself: &quot;Before it strikes quarter past seven I'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock.&quot; And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.&#013;&#013;When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people - he had his father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.&#013;&#013;After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. &quot;That'll be someone from work&quot;, he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remained quiet. &quot;They're not opening the door&quot;, Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it wasn't really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.&#013;&#013;&quot;Something's fallen down in there&quot;, said the chief clerk in the room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to let him know: &quot;Gregor, the chief clerk is here.&quot; &quot;Yes, I know&quot;, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.&#013;&#013;&quot;Gregor&quot;, said his father now from the room to his left, &quot;the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the early train. We don't know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.&quot; Then the chief clerk called &quot;Good morning, Mr. Samsa&quot;. &quot;He isn't well&quot;, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door. &quot;He isn't well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He's made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazed how nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn't have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's so stubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn't.&quot; &quot;I'll be there in a moment&quot;, said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. &quot;Well I can't think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa&quot;, said the chief clerk, &quot;I hope it's nothing serious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.&quot; &quot;Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?&quot;, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again. &quot;No&quot;, said Gregor. In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.&#013;&#013;So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn't know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.&#013;&#013;The chief clerk now raised his voice, &quot;Mr. Samsa&quot;, he called to him, &quot;what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention this just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I'm speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it's not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But Sir&quot;, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, &quot;I'll open up immediately, just a moment. I'm slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get up. I'm still in bed now. I'm quite fresh again now, though. I'm just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It's not quite as easy as I'd thought. I'm quite alright now, though. It's shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don't know why I didn't let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don't make my parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the accusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sent in. I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don't need to wait, sir; I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!&quot;&#013;&#013;And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed - where he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o'clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.&#013;&#013;&quot;Did you understand a word of all that?&quot; the chief clerk asked his parents, &quot;surely he's not trying to make fools of us&quot;. &quot;Oh, God!&quot; called his mother, who was already in tears, &quot;he could be seriously ill and we're making him suffer. Grete! Grete!&quot; she then cried. &quot;Mother?&quot; his sister called from the other side. They communicated across Gregor's room. &quot;You'll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?&quot; &quot;That was the voice of an animal&quot;, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's screams. &quot;Anna! Anna!&quot; his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, &quot;get a locksmith here, now!&quot; And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened.&#013;&#013;Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn't understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.&#013;&#013;Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. &quot;Listen&quot;, said the chief clerk in the next room, &quot;he's turning the key.&quot; Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: &quot;Well done, Gregor&quot;, they should have cried, &quot;keep at it, keep hold of the lock!&quot; And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: &quot;So, I didn't need the locksmith after all&quot;. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.&#013;&#013;Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud &quot;Oh!&quot;, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor's mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.&#013;&#013;So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its fa&ccedil;ade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.&#013;&#013;&quot;Now, then&quot;, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, &quot;I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see&quot;, he said to the chief clerk, &quot;that I'm not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn't earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately, then? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again. Please don't make things any harder for me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That's just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you're also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feel the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don't go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!&quot;&#013;&#013;But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.&#013;&#013;Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: &quot;Help, for pity's sake, Help!&quot; The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.&#013;&#013;&quot;Mother, mother&quot;, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's father into a panic as well. Until then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went. Gregor's appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.&#013;&#013;II&#013;It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.&#013;&#013;It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.&#013;&#013;Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor's sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. &quot;What a quiet life it is the family lead&quot;, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.&#013;&#013;Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.&#013;&#013;It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life. For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.&#013;&#013;He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.&#013;&#013;Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be somewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn't do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. &quot;Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?&quot;, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn't stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out. She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.&#013;&#013;This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor's sister would send the maid away on some errand. Gregor's father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.&#013;&#013;It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. &quot;He's enjoyed his dinner today&quot;, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, &quot;now everything's just been left there again&quot;.&#013;&#013;Although Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor's mother to let her go without delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.&#013;&#013;Now Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than &quot;no thanks, I've had enough&quot; or something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud &quot;No&quot;, and no more would be said.&#013;&#013;Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father's business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained close to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.&#013;&#013;That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening. There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent. &quot;What's that he's doing now&quot;, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.&#013;&#013;When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not understand everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.&#013;&#013;This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That's to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that he had not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.&#013;&#013;He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.&#013;&#013;If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.&#013;&#013;One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, his sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.&#013;&#013;For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out: &quot;Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can't you understand I have to see him?&quot;, and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.&#013;&#013;Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his sister noticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about - and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent. First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. &quot;You can come in, he can't be seen&quot;, said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that she would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added &quot;and by taking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing that we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'll find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in between all the easier&quot;.&#013;&#013;Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.&#013;&#013;His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his mother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all. Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.&#013;&#013;So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor's mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother's attention. She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.&#013;&#013;Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides. With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school - he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.&#013;&#013;So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed in copious fur. He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.&#013;&#013;They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. &quot;What shall we take now, then?&quot;, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: &quot;Come on, let's go back in the living room for a while?&quot; Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at Grete's face.&#013;&#013;But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: &quot;Oh God, oh God!&quot; Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. &quot;Gregor!&quot; shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.&#013;&#013;He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. &quot;What's happened?&quot; were his first words; Grete's appearance must have made everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: &quot;Mother's fainted, but she's better now. Gregor got out.&quot; &quot;Just as I expected&quot;, said his father, &quot;just as I always said, but you women wouldn't listen, would you.&quot; It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.&#013;&#013;His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; &quot;Ah!&quot;, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost his ability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begging him to spare Gregor's life.&#013;&#013;III&#013;No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.&#013;&#013;Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility - probably permanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.&#013;&#013;They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother &quot;you're doing so much sewing again today!&quot;, as if he did not know that he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.&#013;&#013;With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.&#013;&#013;As soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. Gregor's mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: &quot;What a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!&quot; And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.&#013;&#013;Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor's room and say &quot;Close that door, Grete&quot;, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.&#013;&#013;Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor's sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or - more often than not - had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up Gregor's room was for her and her alone. Gregor's mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.&#013;&#013;Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's room and found herself face to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as &quot;come on then, you old dung-beetle!&quot;, or &quot;look at the old dung-beetle there!&quot; Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back. &quot;Aren't you coming any closer, then?&quot;, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.&#013;&#013;Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into Gregor's room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.&#013;&#013;The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.&#013;&#013;The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor's father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. &quot;I'd like to eat something&quot;, said Gregor anxiously, &quot;but not anything like they're eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!&quot;&#013;&#013;Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: &quot;Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.&quot; &quot;On the contrary&quot;, said the middle gentleman, &quot;would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, we'd love to&quot;, called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of the way in a corner.&#013;&#013;His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What's more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.&#013;&#013;No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor's father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor's sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if this misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.&#013;&#013;&quot;Mr. Samsa!&quot;, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it. They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor's sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward. Under his sister's experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. Gregor's father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor's father to a halt. &quot;I declare here and now&quot;, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and sister to gain their attention too, &quot;that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family&quot; - here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - &quot;I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.&quot; He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: &quot;And we also give immediate notice.&quot; With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.&#013;&#013;Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.&#013;&#013;&quot;Father, Mother&quot;, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, &quot;we can't carry on like this. Maybe you can't see it, but I can. I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We've done all that's humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;She's absolutely right&quot;, said Gregor's father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.&#013;&#013;Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.&#013;&#013;&quot;We have to try and get rid of it&quot;, said Gregor's sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, &quot;it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can't endure it. I can't endure it any more.&quot; And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.&#013;&#013;&quot;My child&quot;, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, &quot;what are we to do?&quot;&#013;&#013;His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.&#013;&#013;&quot;If he could just understand us&quot;, said his father almost as a question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question.&#013;&#013;&quot;If he could just understand us&quot;, repeated Gregor's father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite impossible, &quot;then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as it is ...&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;It's got to go&quot;, shouted his sister, &quot;that's the only way, Father. You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor. We've only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will. We wouldn't have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. Father, look, just look&quot;, she suddenly screamed, &quot;he's starting again!&quot; In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.&#013;&#013;But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.&#013;&#013;&quot;Maybe now they'll let me turn round&quot;, thought Gregor and went back to work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.&#013;&#013;He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents &quot;At last!&quot;.&#013;&#013;&quot;What now, then?&quot;, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.&#013;&#013;When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: &quot;Come and 'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!&quot;&#013;&#013;Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor's room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. &quot;Dead?&quot;, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. &quot;That's what I said&quot;, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. &quot;Now then&quot;, said Mr. Samsa, &quot;let's give thanks to God for that&quot;. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: &quot;Just look how thin he was. He didn't eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in&quot;. Gregor's body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.&#013;&#013;&quot;Grete, come with us in here for a little while&quot;, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all.&#013;&#013;The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. &quot;Where is our breakfast?&quot;, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's room. They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.&#013;&#013;Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father's arm.&#013;&#013;&quot;Leave my home. Now!&quot;, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. &quot;I mean just what I said&quot;, answered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. &quot;Alright, we'll go then&quot;, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.&#013;&#013;They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished her work for that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. &quot;Well?&quot;, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. &quot;What is it you want then?&quot;, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. &quot;Yes&quot;, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, &quot;well then, that thing in there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it. That's all been sorted out.&quot; Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out &quot;Cheerio then, everyone&quot;, turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.&#013;&#013;&quot;Tonight she gets sacked&quot;, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he called out: &quot;Come here, then. Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of attention&quot;. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.&#013;&#013;After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. They became quieter. Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.",

        "content": "CHAPTER I. PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS&#013;1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this &quot;Will to Truth&quot; in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Will&#x2014;until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before us&#x2014;or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.&#013;&#013;2. &quot;HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own&#x2014;in this transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the 'Thing-in-itself&#x2014;THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!&quot;&#x2014;This mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this &quot;belief&quot; of theirs, they exert themselves for their &quot;knowledge,&quot; for something that is in the end solemnly christened &quot;the Truth.&quot; The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, &quot;DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.&quot; For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from below&#x2014;&quot;frog perspectives,&quot; as it were, to borrow an expression current among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true, the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed things&#x2014;perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps! But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous &quot;Perhapses&quot;! For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto prevalent&#x2014;philosophers of the dangerous &quot;Perhaps&quot; in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I see such new philosophers beginning to appear.&#013;&#013;3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and &quot;innateness.&quot; As little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is &quot;being-conscious&quot; OPPOSED to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than &quot;truth&quot; such valuations, in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations, special kinds of niaiserie, such as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing, in effect, that man is not just the &quot;measure of things.&quot;&#013;&#013;4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live&#x2014;that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.&#013;&#013;5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they are&#x2014;how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike they are,&#x2014;but that there is not enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of &quot;inspiration&quot;), whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or &quot;suggestion,&quot; which is generally their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub &quot;truths,&quot;&#x2014;and VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his &quot;categorical imperative&quot;&#x2014;makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and mask&#x2014;in fact, the &quot;love of HIS wisdom,&quot; to translate the term fairly and squarely&#x2014;in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas Athene:&#x2014;how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!&#013;&#013;6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of&#x2014;namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: &quot;What morality do they (or does he) aim at?&quot; Accordingly, I do not believe that an &quot;impulse to knowledge&quot; is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise&#x2014;&quot;better,&quot; if you will; there there may really be such a thing as an &quot;impulse to knowledge,&quot; some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual &quot;interests&quot; of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another direction&#x2014;in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE IS,&#x2014;that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other.&#013;&#013;7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies &quot;Flatterers of Dionysius&quot;&#x2014;consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say, &quot;They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them&quot; (for Dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters&#x2014;of which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who knows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out?&#013;&#013;8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the &quot;conviction&quot; of the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient mystery:&#013;&#013;Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.&#013;&#013;9. You desire to LIVE &quot;according to Nature&quot;? Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power&#x2014;how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference? To live&#x2014;is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And granted that your imperative, &quot;living according to Nature,&quot; means actually the same as &quot;living according to life&quot;&#x2014;how could you do DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature &quot;according to the Stoa,&quot; and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise&#x2014;and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves&#x2014;Stoicism is self-tyranny&#x2014;Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to &quot;creation of the world,&quot; the will to the causa prima.&#013;&#013;10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with which the problem of &quot;the real and the apparent world&quot; is dealt with at present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who hears only a &quot;Will to Truth&quot; in the background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth&#x2014;a certain extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the forlorn hope&#x2014;has participated therein: that which in the end always prefers a handful of &quot;certainty&quot; to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of &quot;perspective,&quot; in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that &quot;the earth stands still,&quot; and thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one's body?),&#x2014;who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the &quot;immortal soul,&quot; perhaps &quot;the old God,&quot; in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by &quot;modern ideas&quot;? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish to go &quot;back,&quot; but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF&#x2014;and not back!&#013;&#013;11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he said: &quot;This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.&quot; Let us only understand this &quot;could be&quot;! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something&#x2014;at all events &quot;new faculties&quot;&#x2014;of which to be still prouder!&#x2014;But let us reflect for a moment&#x2014;it is high time to do so. &quot;How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?&quot; Kant asks himself&#x2014;and what is really his answer? &quot;BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)&quot;&#x2014;but unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in man&#x2014;for at that time Germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the &quot;Politics of hard fact.&quot; Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves&#x2014;all seeking for &quot;faculties.&quot; And what did they not find&#x2014;in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between &quot;finding&quot; and &quot;inventing&quot;! Above all a faculty for the &quot;transcendental&quot;; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral indignation. Enough, however&#x2014;the world grew older, and the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost&#x2014;old Kant. &quot;By means of a means (faculty)&quot;&#x2014;he had said, or at least meant to say. But, is that&#x2014;an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? &quot;By means of a means (faculty),&quot; namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,&#013;&#013;    Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,&#013;    Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.&#013;But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian question, &quot;How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI possible?&quot; by another question, &quot;Why is belief in such judgments necessary?&quot;&#x2014;in effect, it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and readily&#x2014;synthetic judgments a priori should not &quot;be possible&quot; at all; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which &quot;German philosophy&quot;&#x2014;I hope you understand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet)?&#x2014;has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this, in short&#x2014;&quot;sensus assoupire.&quot;...&#013;&#013;12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)&#x2014;thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that &quot;stood fast&quot; of the earth&#x2014;the belief in &quot;substance,&quot; in &quot;matter,&quot; in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the &quot;atomistic requirements&quot; which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated &quot;metaphysical requirements&quot;: one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of &quot;the soul&quot; thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses&#x2014;as happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as &quot;mortal soul,&quot; and &quot;soul of subjective multiplicity,&quot; and &quot;soul as social structure of the instincts and passions,&quot; want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust&#x2014;it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT&#x2014;and, who knows? perhaps to DISCOVER the new.&#013;&#013;13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength&#x2014;life itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!&#x2014;one of which is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy of principles.&#013;&#013;14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as more&#x2014;namely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes&#x2014;in fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. What is clear, what is &quot;explained&quot;? Only that which can be seen and felt&#x2014;one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence&#x2014;perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses&#x2014;the mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT different from that which the physicists of today offer us&#x2014;and likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the &quot;smallest possible effort,&quot; and the greatest possible blunder. &quot;Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men to do&quot;&#x2014;that is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.&#013;&#013;15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes! Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs&#x2014;?&#013;&#013;16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are &quot;immediate certainties&quot;; for instance, &quot;I think,&quot; or as the superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, &quot;I will&quot;; as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as &quot;the thing in itself,&quot; without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that &quot;immediate certainty,&quot; as well as &quot;absolute knowledge&quot; and the &quot;thing in itself,&quot; involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: &quot;When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is I who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking&#x2014;that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.&quot;&#x2014;In place of the &quot;immediate certainty&quot; in which the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: &quot;Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego' as cause of thought?&quot; He who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who says, &quot;I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain&quot;&#x2014;will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. &quot;Sir,&quot; the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, &quot;it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?&quot;&#013;&#013;17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous minds&#x2014;namely, that a thought comes when &quot;it&quot; wishes, and not when &quot;I&quot; wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the subject &quot;I&quot; is the condition of the predicate &quot;think.&quot; ONE thinks; but that this &quot;one&quot; is precisely the famous old &quot;ego,&quot; is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an &quot;immediate certainty.&quot; After all, one has even gone too far with this &quot;one thinks&quot;&#x2014;even the &quot;one&quot; contains an INTERPRETATION of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here according to the usual grammatical formula&#x2014;&quot;To think is an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently&quot;... It was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides the operating &quot;power,&quot; the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operates&#x2014;the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to get along without this &quot;earth-residuum,&quot; and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to get along without the little &quot;one&quot; (to which the worthy old &quot;ego&quot; has refined itself).&#013;&#013;18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the &quot;free will&quot; owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it.&#013;&#013;19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing&#x2014;he seems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name&#x2014;and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be &quot;unphilosophical&quot;: let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition &quot;AWAY FROM WHICH we go,&quot; the sensation of the condition &quot;TOWARDS WHICH we go,&quot; the sensation of this &quot;FROM&quot; and &quot;TOWARDS&quot; itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting in motion &quot;arms and legs,&quot; commences its action by force of habit, directly we &quot;will&quot; anything. Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is a ruling thought;&#x2014;and let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the &quot;willing,&quot; as if the will would then remain over! In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the command. That which is termed &quot;freedom of the will&quot; is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: &quot;I am free, 'he' must obey&quot;&#x2014;this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that &quot;this and nothing else is necessary now,&quot; the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered&#x2014;and whatever else pertains to the position of the commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,&#x2014;this affair so extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term &quot;I&quot;: a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing&#x2014;to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action. Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command&#x2014;consequently obedience, and therefore action&#x2014;was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. &quot;Freedom of Will&quot;&#x2014;that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order&#x2014;who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful &quot;underwills&quot; or under-souls&#x2014;indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls&#x2014;to his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many &quot;souls&quot;, on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such within the sphere of morals&#x2014;regarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of &quot;life&quot; manifests itself.&#013;&#013;20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent&#x2014;is betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the one after the other&#x2014;to wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar&#x2014;I mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functions&#x2014;it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject is least developed) look otherwise &quot;into the world,&quot; and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.&#x2014;So much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas.&#013;&#013;21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly. The desire for &quot;freedom of will&quot; in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of &quot;free will&quot; and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his &quot;enlightenment&quot; a step further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of &quot;free will&quot;: I mean &quot;non-free will,&quot; which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One should not wrongly MATERIALISE &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect,&quot; as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it &quot;effects&quot; its end; one should use &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding,&#x2014;NOT for explanation. In &quot;being-in-itself&quot; there is nothing of &quot;casual-connection,&quot; of &quot;necessity,&quot; or of &quot;psychological non-freedom&quot;; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there &quot;law&quot; does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as &quot;being-in-itself,&quot; with things, we act once more as we have always acted&#x2014;MYTHOLOGICALLY. The &quot;non-free will&quot; is mythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.&#x2014;It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every &quot;causal-connection&quot; and &quot;psychological necessity,&quot; manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feelings&#x2014;the person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed correctly, the &quot;non-freedom of the will&quot; is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their &quot;responsibility,&quot; their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as &quot;la religion de la souffrance humaine&quot;; that is ITS &quot;good taste.&quot;&#013;&#013;22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but &quot;Nature's conformity to law,&quot; of which you physicists talk so proudly, as though&#x2014;why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad &quot;philology.&quot; It is no matter of fact, no &quot;text,&quot; but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul! &quot;Everywhere equality before the law&#x2014;Nature is not different in that respect, nor better than we&quot;: a fine instance of secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic&#x2014;likewise a second and more refined atheism&#x2014;is once more disguised. &quot;Ni dieu, ni maitre&quot;&#x2014;that, also, is what you want; and therefore &quot;Cheers for natural law!&quot;&#x2014;is it not so? But, as has been said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the same &quot;Nature,&quot; and with regard to the same phenomena, just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of power&#x2014;an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all &quot;Will to Power&quot; before your eyes, that almost every word, and the word &quot;tyranny&quot; itself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor&#x2014;as being too human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you do, namely, that it has a &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;calculable&quot; course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation&#x2014;and you will be eager enough to make this objection?&#x2014;well, so much the better.&#013;&#013;23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has &quot;the heart&quot; against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly conscience&#x2014;still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm! We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither&#x2014;but what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus &quot;makes a sacrifice&quot;&#x2014;it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, on the contrary!&#x2014;will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER II. THE FREE SPIRIT&#013;24. O sancta simplicitas! In what strange simplification and falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!&#x2014;how from the beginning, we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness, and gaiety&#x2014;in order to enjoy life! And only on this solidified, granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as its opposite, but&#x2014;as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable &quot;flesh and blood,&quot; will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones. Here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves error, because, as living itself, it loves life!&#013;&#013;25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering &quot;for the truth's sake&quot;! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earth&#x2014;as though &quot;the Truth&quot; were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way! Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around you who are as a garden&#x2014;or as music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones&#x2014;also the compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunos&#x2014;always become in the end, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his &quot;sacrifice for the sake of truth,&quot; forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a &quot;martyr,&quot; into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any case&#x2014;merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.&#013;&#013;26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority&#x2014;where he may forget &quot;men who are the rule,&quot; as their exception;&#x2014;exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as such, he would one day have to say to himself: &quot;The devil take my good taste! but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception&#x2014;than myself, the exception!&quot; And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go &quot;inside.&quot; The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man&#x2014;and consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's equals):&#x2014;that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the commonplace and &quot;the rule&quot; in themselves, and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES&#x2014;sometimes they wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust&#x2014;namely, where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man of his century&#x2014;he was far profounder than Voltaire, and consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one speaks &quot;badly&quot;&#x2014;and not even &quot;ill&quot;&#x2014;of man, then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society), may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIAR as the indignant man.&#013;&#013;27. It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among those only who think and live otherwise&#x2014;namely, kurmagati [Footnote: Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best &quot;froglike,&quot; mandeikagati [Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be &quot;difficultly understood&quot; myself!)&#x2014;and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards &quot;the good friends,&quot; however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding&#x2014;one can thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends&#x2014;and laugh then also!&#013;&#013;28. What is most difficult to render from one language into another is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the assimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations, which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language; consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germans&#x2014;pardon me for stating the fact that even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the &quot;good old time&quot; to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a time when there was still a &quot;German taste,&quot; which was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the Roman comedy-writers&#x2014;Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO, and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his &quot;Principe&quot; makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to present&#x2014;long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world, or of the &quot;ancient world,&quot; when like him, one has the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to Aristophanes&#x2014;that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no &quot;Bible,&quot; nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic&#x2014;but a book of Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life&#x2014;a Greek life which he repudiated&#x2014;without an Aristophanes!&#013;&#013;29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men!&#013;&#013;30. Our deepest insights must&#x2014;and should&#x2014;appear as follies, and under certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by philosophers&#x2014;among the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and NOT in equality and equal rights&#x2014;are not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwards&#x2014;while the esoteric class views things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe PURE air.&#013;&#013;31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay. Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself&#x2014;still ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon principle the cause AGAINST &quot;youth.&quot;&#x2014;A decade later, and one comprehends that all this was also still&#x2014;youth!&#013;&#013;32. Throughout the longest period of human history&#x2014;one calls it the prehistoric period&#x2014;the value or non-value of an action was inferred from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, &quot;Know thyself!&quot; was then still unknown.&#x2014;In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in &quot;origin,&quot; the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the consequences, the origin&#x2014;what an inversion of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention. The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day.&#x2014;Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in man&#x2014;is it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible, or &quot;sensed&quot; in it, belongs to its surface or skin&#x2014;which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first requires an explanation&#x2014;a sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the self-mounting of morality&#x2014;let that be the name for the long-secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of the soul.&#013;&#013;33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics of &quot;disinterested contemplation,&quot; under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience. There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments &quot;for others&quot; and &quot;NOT for myself,&quot; for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking promptly: &quot;Are they not perhaps&#x2014;DECEPTIONS?&quot;&#x2014;That they PLEASE&#x2014;him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the mere spectator&#x2014;that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!&#013;&#013;34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays, seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the &quot;nature of things.&quot; He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently &quot;the spirit,&quot; responsible for the falseness of the world&#x2014;an honourable exit, which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of&#x2014;he who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be &quot;real&quot; or not, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same description. The belief in &quot;immediate certainties&quot; is a MORAL NAIVETE which does honour to us philosophers; but&#x2014;we have now to cease being &quot;MERELY moral&quot; men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a &quot;bad character,&quot; and consequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a RIGHT to &quot;bad character,&quot; as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth&#x2014;he is now under OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion.&#x2014;Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the &quot;seeming world&quot;&#x2014;well, granted that YOU could do that,&#x2014;at least nothing of your &quot;truth&quot; would thereby remain! Indeed, what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;? Is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblance&#x2014;different valeurs, as the painters say? Why might not the world WHICH CONCERNS US&#x2014;be a fiction? And to any one who suggested: &quot;But to a fiction belongs an originator?&quot;&#x2014;might it not be bluntly replied: WHY? May not this &quot;belong&quot; also belong to the fiction? Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as towards the predicate and object? Might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governess-faith?&#013;&#013;35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in &quot;the truth,&quot; and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it too humanely&#x2014;&quot;il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien&quot;&#x2014;I wager he finds nothing!&#013;&#013;36. Supposing that nothing else is &quot;given&quot; as real but our world of desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other &quot;reality&quot; but just that of our impulses&#x2014;for thinking is only a relation of these impulses to one another:&#x2014;are we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is &quot;given&quot; does not SUFFICE, by means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called mechanical (or &quot;material&quot;) world? I do not mean as an illusion, a &quot;semblance,&quot; a &quot;representation&quot; (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselves&#x2014;as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also, refines and debilitates)&#x2014;as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with one another&#x2014;as a PRIMARY FORM of life?&#x2014;In the end, it is not only permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays&#x2014;it follows &quot;from its definition,&quot; as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in the causality of the will; if we do so&#x2014;and fundamentally our belief IN THIS is just our belief in causality itself&#x2014;we MUST make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality. &quot;Will&quot; can naturally only operate on &quot;will&quot;&#x2014;and not on &quot;matter&quot; (not on &quot;nerves,&quot; for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever &quot;effects&quot; are recognized&#x2014;and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will&#x2014;namely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition&#x2014;it is one problem&#x2014;could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to its &quot;intelligible character&quot;&#x2014;it would simply be &quot;Will to Power,&quot; and nothing else.&#013;&#013;37. &quot;What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but not the devil?&quot;&#x2014;On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends! And who the devil also compels you to speak popularly!&#013;&#013;38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite superfluous when judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make ITS aspect endurable.&#x2014;Or rather, has not this already happened? Have not we ourselves been&#x2014;that &quot;noble posterity&quot;? And, in so far as we now comprehend this, is it not&#x2014;thereby already past?&#013;&#013;39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous&#x2014;excepting, perhaps, the amiable &quot;Idealists,&quot; who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful, and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of it&#x2014;so that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of &quot;truth&quot; it could endure&#x2014;or to speak more plainly, by the extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the wicked who are happy&#x2014;a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing always, to begin with, that the term &quot;philosopher&quot; be not confined to the philosopher who writes books, or even introduces HIS philosophy into books!&#x2014;Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will not omit to underline&#x2014;for it is OPPOSED to German taste. &quot;Pour etre bon philosophe,&quot; says this last great psychologist, &quot;il faut etre sec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.&quot;&#013;&#013;40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question worth asking!&#x2014;it would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask&#x2014;there is so much goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there&#x2014;and that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he manifests.&#013;&#013;41. One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined for independence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not avoid one's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the dearest&#x2014;every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous&#x2014;it is even less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland. Not to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to one's own liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it&#x2014;the danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our &quot;hospitality&quot; for instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELF&#x2014;the best test of independence.&#013;&#013;42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them, as far as they allow themselves to be understood&#x2014;for it is their nature to WISH to remain something of a puzzle&#x2014;these philosophers of the future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as &quot;tempters.&quot; This name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be preferred, a temptation.&#013;&#013;43. Will they be new friends of &quot;truth,&quot; these coming philosophers? Very probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still be truth for every one&#x2014;that which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. &quot;My opinion is MY opinion: another person has not easily a right to it&quot;&#x2014;such a philosopher of the future will say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people. &quot;Good&quot; is no longer good when one's neighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a &quot;common good&quot;! The expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always been&#x2014;the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the rare.&#013;&#013;44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY free spirits, these philosophers of the future&#x2014;as certainly also they will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater, and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the conception of &quot;free spirit&quot; obscure. In every country of Europe, and the same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits, who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts prompt&#x2014;not to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors. Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly named &quot;free spirits&quot;&#x2014;as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of the democratic taste and its &quot;modern ideas&quot; all of them men without solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed&#x2014;a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called &quot;Equality of Rights&quot; and &quot;Sympathy with All Sufferers&quot;&#x2014;and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant &quot;man&quot; has hitherto grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and dissembling power (his &quot;spirit&quot;) had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be increased to the unconditioned Will to Power&#x2014;we believe that severity, violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy, stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind,&#x2014;that everything wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite&#x2014;we do not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any case we find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their antipodes perhaps? What wonder that we &quot;free spirits&quot; are not exactly the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil,&quot; with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something else than &quot;libres-penseurs,&quot; &quot;liben pensatori&quot; &quot;free-thinkers,&quot; and whatever these honest advocates of &quot;modern ideas&quot; like to call themselves. Having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us, full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free us from some rule, and its &quot;prejudice,&quot; grateful to the God, devil, sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure, owing to an excess of &quot;free will&quot;, with anterior and posterior souls, into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry, with foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run, hidden ones under the mantles of light, appropriators, although we resemble heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and collectors from morning till night, misers of our wealth and our full-crammed drawers, economical in learning and forgetting, inventive in scheming, sometimes proud of tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of work even in full day, yea, if necessary, even scarecrows&#x2014;and it is necessary nowadays, that is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn, jealous friends of SOLITUDE, of our own profoundest midnight and midday solitude&#x2014;such kind of men are we, we free spirits! And perhaps ye are also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW philosophers?&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER III. THE RELIGIOUS MOOD&#013;45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME, and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a &quot;big hunt&quot;. But how often must he say despairingly to himself: &quot;A single individual! alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin forest!&quot; So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants, and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the &quot;BIG hunt,&quot; and also the great danger commences,&#x2014;it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality, which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.&#x2014;But who could do me this service! And who would have time to wait for such servants!&#x2014;they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at all times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know something; which means that one has MUCH to do!&#x2014;But a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices&#x2014;pardon me! I mean to say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon earth.&#013;&#013;46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which the Imperium Romanum gave&#x2014;this faith is NOT that sincere, austere slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason&#x2014;a tough, long-lived, worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in the form of which &quot;faith&quot; comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula, &quot;God on the Cross&quot;. Hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a transvaluation of all ancient values&#x2014;It was the Orient, the PROFOUND Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman &quot;Catholicism&quot; of non-faith, and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith, which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them. &quot;Enlightenment&quot; causes revolt, for the slave desires the unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of sickness&#x2014;his many HIDDEN sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the last great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution.&#013;&#013;47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence&#x2014;but without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers&#x2014;perhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or, better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY&#x2014;Yet in the background of the most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the saint possible?&#x2014;that seems to have been the very question with which Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry, type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis&#x2014;or as I call it, &quot;the religious mood&quot;&#x2014;made its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the &quot;Salvation Army&quot;&#x2014;If it be a question, however, as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein&#x2014;namely, the immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that a &quot;bad man&quot; was all at once turned into a &quot;saint,&quot; a good man. The hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions into the text and facts of the case? What? &quot;Miracle&quot; only an error of interpretation? A lack of philology?&#013;&#013;48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among Protestants&#x2014;namely, a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.&#013;&#013;We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even as regards our talents for religion&#x2014;we have POOR talents for it. One may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun of the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their origin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte's Sociology seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical, that amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal, Sainte-Beuve, in spite of all his hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat after him these fine sentences&#x2014;and what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but harder souls, that is to say, in our more German souls!&#x2014;&quot;DISONS DONC HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE L'HOMME NORMAL, QUE L'HOMME EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS ASSURE D'UNE DESTINEE INFINIE.... C'EST QUAND IL EST BON QU'IL VEUT QUE LA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN ORDER ETERNAL, C'EST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES CHOSES D'UNE MANIERE DESINTERESSEE QU'IL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ET ABSURDE. COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C'EST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA, QUE L'HOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?&quot;... These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage on finding them, I wrote on the margin, &quot;LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR EXCELLENCE!&quot;&#x2014;until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such a distinction to have one's own antipodes!&#013;&#013;49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours forth&#x2014;it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitude towards nature and life.&#x2014;Later on, when the populace got the upper hand in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity was preparing itself.&#013;&#013;50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and importunate kinds of it, like that of Luther&#x2014;the whole of Protestantism lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid, also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman in such a case.&#013;&#013;51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary privation&#x2014;why did they thus bow? They divined in him&#x2014;and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance&#x2014;the superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; the strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something in themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this, the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an enormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been coveted for nothing&#x2014;they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered enemy:&#x2014;it was the &quot;Will to Power&quot; which obliged them to halt before the saint. They had to question him.&#013;&#013;52. In the Jewish &quot;Old Testament,&quot; the book of divine justice, there are men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the &quot;Progress of Mankind.&quot; To be sure, he who is himself only a slender, tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like our cultured people of today, including the Christians of &quot;cultured&quot; Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins&#x2014;the taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot;: perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace, still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one book, as the &quot;Bible,&quot; as &quot;The Book in Itself,&quot; is perhaps the greatest audacity and &quot;sin against the Spirit&quot; which literary Europe has upon its conscience.&#013;&#013;53. Why Atheism nowadays? &quot;The father&quot; in God is thoroughly refuted; equally so &quot;the judge,&quot; &quot;the rewarder.&quot; Also his &quot;free will&quot;: he does not hear&#x2014;and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?&#x2014;This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth,&#x2014;it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust.&#013;&#013;54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes&#x2014;and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure&#x2014;an ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conception&#x2014;that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in effect, one believed in &quot;the soul&quot; as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, &quot;I&quot; is the condition, &quot;think&quot; is the predicate and is conditioned&#x2014;to think is an activity for which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,&#x2014;to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: &quot;think&quot; the condition, and &quot;I&quot; the conditioned; &quot;I,&quot; therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved&#x2014;nor the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and therefore of &quot;the soul,&quot; may not always have been strange to him,&#x2014;the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the Vedanta philosophy.&#013;&#013;55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the best&#x2014;to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their &quot;nature&quot;; THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and &quot;anti-natural&quot; fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness&#x2014;this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation; we all know something thereof already.&#013;&#013;56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of Schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all possible modes of thought&#x2014;beyond good and evil, and no longer like Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of morality,&#x2014;whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is, but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity, insatiably calling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires the play&#x2014;and makes it necessary; because he always requires himself anew&#x2014;and makes himself necessary.&#x2014;What? And this would not be&#x2014;circulus vitiosus deus?&#013;&#013;57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and suffering, the conceptions &quot;God&quot; and &quot;sin,&quot; will one day seem to us of no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to an old man;&#x2014;and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for &quot;the old man&quot;&#x2014;always childish enough, an eternal child!&#013;&#013;58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft placidity called &quot;prayer,&quot; the state of perpetual readiness for the &quot;coming of God&quot;), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURING&#x2014;that it vulgarizes body and soul&#x2014;is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for &quot;unbelief&quot; more than anything else? Among these, for instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I find &quot;free-thinkers&quot; of diversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the &quot;Fatherland,&quot; and the newspapers, and their &quot;family duties&quot;; it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure&#x2014;for it is impossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many things are done&#x2014;with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;&#x2014;they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the &quot;uncleanliness&quot; of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.&#x2014;Every age has its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much naivete&#x2014;adorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE which he himself has developed&#x2014;he, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of &quot;ideas,&quot; of &quot;modern ideas&quot;!&#013;&#013;59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of &quot;pure forms&quot; in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it. Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and deified,&#x2014;one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the &quot;Life in God,&quot; regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer offends.&#013;&#013;60. To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE&#x2014;this has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankind, without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclination&#x2014;whoever first perceived and &quot;experienced&quot; this, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion!&#013;&#013;61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him&#x2014;as the man of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general development of mankind,&#x2014;will use religion for his disciplining and educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining influence&#x2014;destructive, as well as creative and fashioning&#x2014;which can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority&#x2014;as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live&#x2014;this very difficulty being necessary.&#013;&#013;62. To be sure&#x2014;to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers&#x2014;the cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions&#x2014;to give a general appreciation of them&#x2014;are among the principal causes which have kept the type of &quot;man&quot; upon a lower level&#x2014;they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the &quot;spiritual men&quot; of Christianity have done for Europe hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless, and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value&#x2014;THAT is what they had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous, manly, conquering, and imperious&#x2014;all instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of &quot;man&quot;&#x2014;into uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly things&#x2014;THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value, &quot;unworldliness,&quot; &quot;unsensuousness,&quot; and &quot;higher man&quot; fused into one sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: &quot;Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands? How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed to do!&quot;&#x2014;I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man:&#x2014;SUCH men, with their &quot;equality before God,&quot; have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the present day.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER IV. APOPHTHEGMS AND INTERLUDES&#013;63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously&#x2014;and even himself&#x2014;only in relation to his pupils.&#013;&#013;64. &quot;Knowledge for its own sake&quot;&#x2014;that is the last snare laid by morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.&#013;&#013;65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has to be overcome on the way to it.&#013;&#013;65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to sin.&#013;&#013;66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.&#013;&#013;67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of all others. Love to God also!&#013;&#013;68. &quot;I did that,&quot; says my memory. &quot;I could not have done that,&quot; says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually&#x2014;the memory yields.&#013;&#013;69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand that&#x2014;kills with leniency.&#013;&#013;70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which always recurs.&#013;&#013;71. THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.&#x2014;So long as thou feelest the stars as an &quot;above thee,&quot; thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.&#013;&#013;72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that makes great men.&#013;&#013;73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.&#013;&#013;73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye&#x2014;and calls it his pride.&#013;&#013;74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things besides: gratitude and purity.&#013;&#013;75. The degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest altitudes of his spirit.&#013;&#013;76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.&#013;&#013;77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify, or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.&#013;&#013;78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a despiser.&#013;&#013;79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love, betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.&#013;&#013;80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us&#x2014;What did the God mean who gave the advice, &quot;Know thyself!&quot; Did it perhaps imply &quot;Cease to be concerned about thyself! become objective!&quot;&#x2014;And Socrates?&#x2014;And the &quot;scientific man&quot;?&#013;&#013;81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you should so salt your truth that it will no longer&#x2014;quench thirst?&#013;&#013;82. &quot;Sympathy for all&quot;&#x2014;would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my good neighbour.&#013;&#013;83. INSTINCT&#x2014;When the house is on fire one forgets even the dinner&#x2014;Yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes.&#013;&#013;84. Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she&#x2014;forgets how to charm.&#013;&#013;85. The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.&#013;&#013;86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves have still their impersonal scorn&#x2014;for &quot;woman&quot;.&#013;&#013;87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT&#x2014;When one firmly fetters one's heart and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they know it already.&#013;&#013;88. One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become embarrassed.&#013;&#013;89. Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences them is not something dreadful also.&#013;&#013;90. Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy&#x2014;by hatred and love.&#013;&#013;91. So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him! Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!&#x2014;And for that very reason many think him red-hot.&#013;&#013;92. Who has not, at one time or another&#x2014;sacrificed himself for the sake of his good name?&#013;&#013;93. In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that account a great deal too much contempt of men.&#013;&#013;94. The maturity of man&#x2014;that means, to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play.&#013;&#013;95. To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.&#013;&#013;96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa&#x2014;blessing it rather than in love with it.&#013;&#013;97. What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own ideal.&#013;&#013;98. When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.&#013;&#013;99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS&#x2014;&quot;I listened for the echo and I heard only praise.&quot;&#013;&#013;100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus relax ourselves away from our fellows.&#013;&#013;101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the animalization of God.&#013;&#013;102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with regard to the beloved. &quot;What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or stupid enough? Or&#x2014;or&#x2014;-&quot;&#013;&#013;103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.&#x2014;&quot;Everything now turns out best for me, I now love every fate:&#x2014;who would like to be my fate?&quot;&#013;&#013;104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love, prevents the Christians of today&#x2014;burning us.&#013;&#013;105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the &quot;piety&quot;) of the free spirit (the &quot;pious man of knowledge&quot;) than the impia fraus. Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church, characteristic of the type &quot;free spirit&quot;&#x2014;as ITS non-freedom.&#013;&#013;106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.&#013;&#013;107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally, therefore, a will to stupidity.&#013;&#013;108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena.&#013;&#013;109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates and maligns it.&#013;&#013;110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.&#013;&#013;111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been wounded.&#013;&#013;112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against them.&#013;&#013;113. &quot;You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be embarrassed before him.&quot;&#013;&#013;114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.&#013;&#013;115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is mediocre.&#013;&#013;116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.&#013;&#013;117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of another, or of several other, emotions.&#013;&#013;118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.&#013;&#013;119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning ourselves&#x2014;&quot;justifying&quot; ourselves.&#013;&#013;120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its root remains weak, and is easily torn up.&#013;&#013;121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn author&#x2014;and that he did not learn it better.&#013;&#013;122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness of heart&#x2014;and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.&#013;&#013;123. Even concubinage has been corrupted&#x2014;by marriage.&#013;&#013;124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.&#013;&#013;125. When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.&#013;&#013;126. A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great men.&#x2014;Yes, and then to get round them.&#013;&#013;127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it&#x2014;or worse still! under their dress and finery.&#013;&#013;128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you allure the senses to it.&#013;&#013;129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that account he keeps so far away from him:&#x2014;the devil, in effect, as the oldest friend of knowledge.&#013;&#013;130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent decreases,&#x2014;when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.&#013;&#013;131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.&#013;&#013;132. One is punished best for one's virtues.&#013;&#013;133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and shamelessly than the man without an ideal.&#013;&#013;134. From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience, all evidence of truth.&#013;&#013;135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.&#013;&#013;136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates.&#013;&#013;137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man.&#013;&#013;138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse&#x2014;and forget it immediately.&#013;&#013;139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.&#013;&#013;140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.&#x2014;&quot;If the band is not to break, bite it first&#x2014;secure to make!&quot;&#013;&#013;141. The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself for a God.&#013;&#013;142. The chastest utterance I ever heard: &quot;Dans le veritable amour c'est l'ame qui enveloppe le corps.&quot;&#013;&#013;143. Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is most difficult to us.&#x2014;Concerning the origin of many systems of morals.&#013;&#013;144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally something wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is &quot;the barren animal.&quot;&#013;&#013;145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the SECONDARY role.&#013;&#013;146. He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.&#013;&#013;147. From old Florentine novels&#x2014;moreover, from life: Buona femmina e mala femmina vuol bastone.&#x2014;Sacchetti, Nov. 86.&#013;&#013;148. To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards to believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour&#x2014;who can do this conjuring trick so well as women?&#013;&#013;149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of what was formerly considered good&#x2014;the atavism of an old ideal.&#013;&#013;150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the demigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything becomes&#x2014;what? perhaps a &quot;world&quot;?&#013;&#013;151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your permission to possess it;&#x2014;eh, my friends?&#013;&#013;152. &quot;Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise&quot;: so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.&#013;&#013;153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.&#013;&#013;154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.&#013;&#013;155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness.&#013;&#013;156. Insanity in individuals is something rare&#x2014;but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.&#013;&#013;157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets successfully through many a bad night.&#013;&#013;158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our strongest impulse&#x2014;the tyrant in us.&#013;&#013;159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us good or ill?&#013;&#013;160. One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has communicated it.&#013;&#013;161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.&#013;&#013;162. &quot;Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's neighbour&quot;:&#x2014;so thinks every nation.&#013;&#013;163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover&#x2014;his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his normal character.&#013;&#013;164. Jesus said to his Jews: &quot;The law was for servants;&#x2014;love God as I love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!&quot;&#013;&#013;165. IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.&#x2014;A shepherd has always need of a bell-wether&#x2014;or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.&#013;&#013;166. One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.&#013;&#013;167. To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame&#x2014;and something precious.&#013;&#013;168. Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it, certainly, but degenerated to Vice.&#013;&#013;169. To talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing oneself.&#013;&#013;170. In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.&#013;&#013;171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like tender hands on a Cyclops.&#013;&#013;172. One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never confess to the individual.&#013;&#013;173. One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one esteems equal or superior.&#013;&#013;174. Ye Utilitarians&#x2014;ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE for your inclinations,&#x2014;ye, too, really find the noise of its wheels insupportable!&#013;&#013;175. One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.&#013;&#013;176. The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is counter to our vanity.&#013;&#013;177. With regard to what &quot;truthfulness&quot; is, perhaps nobody has ever been sufficiently truthful.&#013;&#013;178. One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a forfeiture of the rights of man!&#013;&#013;179. The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile &quot;reformed.&quot;&#013;&#013;180. There is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a cause.&#013;&#013;181. It is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed.&#013;&#013;182. The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be returned.&#013;&#013;183. &quot;I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you.&quot;&#013;&#013;184. There is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of wickedness.&#013;&#013;185. &quot;I dislike him.&quot;&#x2014;Why?&#x2014;&quot;I am not a match for him.&quot;&#x2014;Did any one ever answer so?&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS&#013;186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the &quot;Science of Morals&quot; belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:&#x2014;an interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, &quot;Science of Morals&quot; is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,&#x2014;which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish&#x2014;and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizations&#x2014;as preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest. All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality&#x2014;and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something &quot;given.&quot; How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem&#x2014;left in dust and decay&#x2014;of a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement&#x2014;perhaps as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their climate and zone&#x2014;it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of morals&#x2014;problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every &quot;Science of Morals&quot; hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there! That which philosophers called &quot;giving a basis to morality,&quot; and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light, proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question&#x2014;and in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocence&#x2014;almost worthy of honour&#x2014;Schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a &quot;Science&quot; whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: &quot;The principle,&quot; he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality, translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] &quot;the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva&#x2014;is REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries.&quot;&#x2014;The difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great&#x2014;it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLY&#x2014;played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality&#x2014;who assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what? Is that really&#x2014;a pessimist?&#013;&#013;187. Apart from the value of such assertions as &quot;there is a categorical imperative in us,&quot; one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,&#x2014;this system of morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant especially, gives us to understand by his morals that &quot;what is estimable in me, is that I know how to obey&#x2014;and with you it SHALL not be otherwise than with me!&quot; In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.&#013;&#013;188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against &quot;nature&quot; and also against &quot;reason&quot;, that is, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedom&#x2014;the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves!&#x2014;not excepting some of the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness&#x2014;&quot;for the sake of a folly,&quot; as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wise&#x2014;&quot;from submission to arbitrary laws,&quot; as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves &quot;free,&quot; even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself, or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this is &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;&#x2014;and not laisser-aller! Every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his &quot;most natural&quot; condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and constructing in the moments of &quot;inspiration&quot;&#x2014;and how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it). The essential thing &quot;in heaven and in earth&quot; is, apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality&#x2014;anything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:&#x2014;all this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, &quot;nature&quot; shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove something&#x2014;nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker who &quot;wishes to prove something&quot;&#x2014;that it was always settled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events &quot;for the glory of God,&quot; or &quot;for the good of the soul&quot;:&#x2014;this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this light: it is &quot;nature&quot; therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for immediate duties&#x2014;it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development. &quot;Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for thyself&quot;&#x2014;this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither &quot;categorical,&quot; as old Kant wished (consequently the &quot;otherwise&quot;), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the animal &quot;man&quot; generally, to MANKIND.&#013;&#013;189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week&#x2014;and work-day again:&#x2014;as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself&#x2014;at the same time also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal odours).&#x2014;Here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).&#013;&#013;190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble. &quot;No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him&#x2014;good.&quot;&#x2014;This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that &quot;it is STUPID to do wrong&quot;; while they accept &quot;good&quot; as identical with &quot;useful and pleasant,&quot; without further thought. As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.&#x2014;Plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them&#x2014;he, the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications&#x2014;namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates, if not&#x2014;[Greek words inserted here.]&#013;&#013;191. The old theological problem of &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Knowledge,&quot; or more plainly, of instinct and reason&#x2014;the question whether, in respect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to a &quot;Why,&quot; that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility&#x2014;it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent&#x2014;that of a surpassing dialectician&#x2014;took first the side of reason; and, in fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions? In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. &quot;But why&quot;&#x2014;he said to himself&#x2014;&quot;should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO&#x2014;one must follow the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments.&quot; This was the real FALSENESS of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment.&#x2014;Plato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure of all his strength&#x2014;the greatest strength a philosopher had ever expended&#x2014;that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to &quot;God&quot;; and since Plato, all theologians and philosophers have followed the same path&#x2014;which means that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it, &quot;Faith,&quot; or as I call it, &quot;the herd&quot;) has hitherto triumphed. Unless one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and Descartes was superficial.&#013;&#013;192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all &quot;knowledge and cognizance&quot;: there, as here, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to &quot;belief,&quot; and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed&#x2014;our senses learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more &quot;morality.&quot; It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more familiar and conversant&#x2014;it was thus, for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the &quot;simplest&quot; processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATE&#x2014;such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.&#x2014;As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page&#x2014;he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random, and &quot;guesses&quot; the probably appropriate sense to them&#x2014;just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as &quot;inventors&quot; thereof. All this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have been&#x2014;ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly&#x2014;one is much more of an artist than one is aware of.&#x2014;In an animated conversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of my visual faculty&#x2014;the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me. Probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all.&#013;&#013;193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything &quot;actually&quot; experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an &quot;upwards&quot; without effort or constraint, a &quot;downwards&quot; without descending or lowering&#x2014;without TROUBLE!&#x2014;how could the man with such dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find &quot;happiness&quot; differently coloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he fail&#x2014;to long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? &quot;Flight,&quot; such as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own &quot;flying,&quot; be far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too &quot;troublesome&quot; for him.&#013;&#013;194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable things&#x2014;in their regarding different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized desirable things:&#x2014;it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession, sees the &quot;questionableness,&quot; the mere apparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have&#x2014;only THEN does he look upon her as &quot;possessed.&quot; A third, however, has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: &quot;One may not deceive where one desires to possess&quot;&#x2014;he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: &quot;I must, therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!&quot; Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance, he should &quot;merit&quot; help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children&#x2014;they call that &quot;education&quot;; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The consequence is...&#013;&#013;195. The Jews&#x2014;a people &quot;born for slavery,&quot; as Tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them; &quot;the chosen people among the nations,&quot; as they themselves say and believe&#x2014;the Jews performed the miracle of the inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused into one the expressions &quot;rich,&quot; &quot;godless,&quot; &quot;wicked,&quot; &quot;violent,&quot; &quot;sensual,&quot; and for the first time coined the word &quot;world&quot; as a term of reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the word &quot;poor&quot; as synonymous with &quot;saint&quot; and &quot;friend&quot;) the significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.&#013;&#013;196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the sun&#x2014;such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an allegory; and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.&#013;&#013;197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia) are fundamentally misunderstood, &quot;nature&quot; is misunderstood, so long as one seeks a &quot;morbidness&quot; in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate &quot;hell&quot; in them&#x2014;as almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And that the &quot;tropical man&quot; must be discredited at all costs, whether as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and self-torture? And why? In favour of the &quot;temperate zones&quot;? In favour of the temperate men? The &quot;moral&quot;? The mediocre?&#x2014;This for the chapter: &quot;Morals as Timidity.&quot;&#013;&#013;198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their &quot;happiness,&quot; as it is called&#x2014;what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form&#x2014;because they address themselves to &quot;all,&quot; because they generalize where generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously, especially of &quot;the other world.&quot; That is all of little value when estimated intellectually, and is far from being &quot;science,&quot; much less &quot;wisdom&quot;; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity, stupidity&#x2014;whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake&#x2014;for in religion the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally, even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it &quot;no longer has much danger.&quot;&#x2014;This also for the chapter: &quot;Morals as Timidity.&quot;&#013;&#013;199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command&#x2014;in view, therefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives the command &quot;Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from something&quot;, in short, &quot;Thou shalt&quot;. This need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders&#x2014;parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things actually exists in Europe at present&#x2014;I call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as &quot;first servants of their people,&quot; or &quot;instruments of the public weal&quot;. On the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans&#x2014;of this fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods.&#013;&#013;200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body&#x2014;that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace&#x2014;such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity&#x2014;it is the &quot;Sabbath of Sabbaths,&quot; to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man.&#x2014;Should, however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus to life&#x2014;and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring from the same causes.&#013;&#013;201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no &quot;morality of love to one's neighbour.&quot; Granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness, gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as &quot;virtues,&quot; and eventually almost coincide with the conception &quot;morality&quot;: in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations&#x2014;they are still ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA. After all, &quot;love to our neighbour&quot; is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility&#x2014;under other names, of course, than those here given&#x2014;but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong&#x2014;when the outlets for them are lacking&#x2014;and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment&#x2014;that is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, &quot;the lamb,&quot; and still more &quot;the sheep,&quot; wins respect. There is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be somehow unfair&#x2014;it is certain that the idea of &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;the obligation to punish&quot; are then painful and alarming to people. &quot;Is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!&quot;&#x2014;with these questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!&#x2014;Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European, will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd &quot;we wish that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!&quot; Some time or other&#x2014;the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called &quot;progress&quot; all over Europe.&#013;&#013;202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths&#x2014;OUR truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to men of &quot;modern ideas&quot; that we have constantly applied the terms &quot;herd,&quot; &quot;herd-instincts,&quot; and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach&#x2014;they &quot;know&quot; today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a &quot;possibility,&quot; against such a &quot;should be,&quot; however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably &quot;I am morality itself and nothing else is morality!&quot; Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call themselves Socialists and want a &quot;free society,&quot; those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of repudiating the notions &quot;master&quot; and &quot;servant&quot;&#x2014;ni dieu ni maitre, says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs &quot;rights&quot; any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals, up even to &quot;God&quot;&#x2014;the extravagance of &quot;sympathy for God&quot; belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening, under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present, the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in &quot;themselves.&quot;&#013;&#013;203. We, who hold a different belief&#x2014;we, who regard the democratic movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In NEW PHILOSOPHERS&#x2014;there is no other alternative: in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue and invert &quot;eternal valuations&quot;; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of &quot;history&quot; (the folly of the &quot;greatest number&quot; is only its last form)&#x2014;for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUR eyes:&#x2014;is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:&#x2014;these are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of &quot;man&quot; himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankind&#x2014;a game in which neither the hand, nor even a &quot;finger of God&quot; has participated!&#x2014;he who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; and still more under the whole of Christo-European morality&#x2014;suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths:&#x2014;he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the &quot;man of the future&quot;&#x2014;as idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates&#x2014;this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of &quot;free society&quot;), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of mankind&#x2014;and perhaps also a new MISSION!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS&#013;204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always been&#x2014;namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES, according to Balzac&#x2014;I would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right out of one's own EXPERIENCE&#x2014;experience, as it seems to me, always implies unfortunate experience?&#x2014;to treat of such an important question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science like women and artists (&quot;Ah! this dreadful science!&quot; sigh their instinct and their shame, &quot;it always FINDS THINGS OUT!&quot;). The declaration of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime&#x2014;which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, &quot;Freedom from all masters!&quot; and after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose &quot;hand-maid&quot; it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the &quot;master&quot;&#x2014;what am I saying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory&#x2014;the memory of a scientific man, if you please!&#x2014;teems with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which &quot;does nobody any good&quot;. At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of&#x2014;the result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down below&#x2014;in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves &quot;realists,&quot; or &quot;positivists,&quot; which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the &quot;more&quot; and its responsibility&#x2014;and who now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise? Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to a &quot;theory of knowledge,&quot; no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enter&#x2014;that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy&#x2014;RULE!&#013;&#013;205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and &quot;specialize&quot; so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcher&#x2014;in short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life&#x2014;he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives &quot;wisely,&quot; or &quot;as a philosopher,&quot; it hardly means anything more than &quot;prudently and apart.&quot; Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher&#x2014;does it not seem so to US, my friends?&#x2014;lives &quot;unphilosophically&quot; and &quot;unwisely,&quot; above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of life&#x2014;he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad game.&#013;&#013;206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either ENGENDERS or PRODUCES&#x2014;both words understood in their fullest sense&#x2014;the man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnification&#x2014;in these cases one emphasizes the respectability&#x2014;and yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require&#x2014;for instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved&#x2014;his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours to break&#x2014;or still better, to relax&#x2014;every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent hand&#x2014;to RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.&#013;&#013;207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit&#x2014;and who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded IPSISIMOSITY!&#x2014;in the end, however, one must learn caution even with regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and glorification&#x2014;as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to &quot;disinterested knowledge&quot; The objective man, who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR&#x2014;he is no &quot;purpose in himself&quot; The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or &quot;reflecting&quot; implies&#x2014;he waits until something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film Whatever &quot;personality&quot; he still possesses seems to him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events He calls up the recollection of &quot;himself&quot; with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and society&#x2014;indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his!&#x2014;and as man generally, he becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one wish love or hatred from him&#x2014;I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and animal understand them&#x2014;he will do what he can, and furnish what he can. But one must not be surprised if it should not be much&#x2014;if he should show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality is he still &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;natural.&quot; His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. &quot;JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN&quot;&#x2014;he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has been overlooked&#x2014;he is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in himself&#x2014;PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination&#x2014;and still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to &quot;shape&quot; itself thereto&#x2014;for the most part a man without frame and content, a &quot;selfless&quot; man. Consequently, also, nothing for women, IN PARENTHESI.&#013;&#013;208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic&#x2014;I hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit?&#x2014;people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means denial, but&#x2014;dreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of &quot;good-will&quot;&#x2014;a will to the veritable, actual negation of life&#x2014;there is, as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the &quot;spirit,&quot; and its underground noises. &quot;Are not our ears already full of bad sounds?&quot; say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; &quot;this subterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles!&quot; The skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!&#x2014;they seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: &quot;What do I know?&quot; Or with Socrates: &quot;I know that I know nothing.&quot; Or: &quot;Here I do not trust myself, no door is open to me.&quot; Or: &quot;Even if the door were open, why should I enter immediately?&quot; Or: &quot;What is the use of any hasty hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.&quot;&#x2014;Thus does a skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however, which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing&#x2014;they are doubtful of the &quot;freedom of the will&quot; even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs&#x2014;and often sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How seductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in the show-cases as &quot;objectiveness,&quot; &quot;the scientific spirit,&quot; &quot;L'ART POUR L'ART,&quot; and &quot;pure voluntary knowledge,&quot; is only decked-out skepticism and paralysis of will&#x2014;I am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the European disease&#x2014;The disease of the will is diffused unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases according as &quot;the barbarian&quot; still&#x2014;or again&#x2014;asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter&#x2014;not to mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia&#x2014;namely, in Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated, there the will&#x2014;uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative&#x2014;waits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the contrary&#x2014;I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening&#x2014;namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world&#x2014;the COMPULSION to great politics.&#013;&#013;209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical genius&#x2014;and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form&#x2014;his ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever Frenchmen&#x2014;he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism&#x2014;who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude?&#x2014;the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great German philologists and historical critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually established itself&#x2014;in spite of all Romanticism in music and philosophy&#x2014;in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the &quot;man&quot; in the German spirit which awakened Europe out of its &quot;dogmatic slumber,&quot; let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new one&#x2014;and that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the &quot;German spirit&quot; &quot;VOILA UN HOMME!&quot;&#x2014;that was as much as to say &quot;But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!&quot;&#013;&#013;210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be designated thereby&#x2014;and not they themselves. With equal right they might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments. By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of?&#x2014;There is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the &quot;truth&quot; in order that it may &quot;please&quot; them, or &quot;elevate&quot; and &quot;inspire&quot; them&#x2014;they will rather have little faith in &quot;TRUTH&quot; bringing with it such revels for the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one says in their presence &quot;That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?&quot; or &quot;That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?&quot; or &quot;That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?&quot; Perhaps they will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile &quot;Christian sentiments&quot; with &quot;antique taste,&quot; or even with &quot;modern parliamentarism&quot; (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment&#x2014;nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that &quot;philosophy itself is criticism and critical science&#x2014;and nothing else whatever!&quot; Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic.&#013;&#013;211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophers&#x2014;that precisely here one should strictly give &quot;each his own,&quot; and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and &quot;free spirit,&quot; and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something else&#x2014;it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuations&#x2014;that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a time called &quot;truths&quot;&#x2014;whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long, even &quot;time&quot; itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: &quot;Thus SHALL it be!&quot; They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators of the past&#x2014;they grasp at the future with a creative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an instrument, and a hammer. Their &quot;knowing&quot; is CREATING, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth is&#x2014;WILL TO POWER.&#x2014;Are there at present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST there not be such philosophers some day? ...&#013;&#013;212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers&#x2014;who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators&#x2014;have found their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end, however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said &quot;We must remove hence to where YOU are least at home&quot; In the face of a world of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a &quot;specialty,&quot; a philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the conception of &quot;greatness,&quot; precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception of &quot;greatness&quot;, with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite age&#x2014;such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves go&#x2014;&quot;for the sake of happiness,&quot; as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicated&#x2014;and who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the &quot;noble,&quot; with a look that said plainly enough &quot;Do not dissemble before me! here&#x2014;we are equal!&quot; At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when &quot;equality of right&quot; can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong&#x2014;I mean to say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness&#x2014;at present it belongs to the conception of &quot;greatness&quot; to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts &quot;He shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full.&quot; And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE&#x2014;nowadays?&#013;&#013;213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: one must &quot;know&quot; it by experience&#x2014;or one should have the pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:&#x2014;the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as &quot;worthy of the SWEAT of the noble&quot;&#x2014;but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! &quot;To think&quot; and to take a matter &quot;seriously,&quot; &quot;arduously&quot;&#x2014;that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been their &quot;experience.&quot;&#x2014;Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything &quot;arbitrarily,&quot; and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax&#x2014;in short, that necessity and &quot;freedom of will&quot; are then the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this &quot;holy of holies&quot;&#x2014;as so often happens nowadays! But coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have always to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has only a right to philosophy&#x2014;taking the word in its higher significance&#x2014;in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the &quot;blood,&quot; decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves....&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER VII. OUR VIRTUES&#013;214. OUR Virtues?&#x2014;It is probable that we, too, have still our virtues, although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings of the twentieth century&#x2014;with all our dangerous curiosity, our multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit&#x2014;we shall presumably, IF we must have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements: well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!&#x2014;where, as we know, so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost! And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this &quot;believing in one's own virtues&quot;&#x2014;is it not practically the same as what was formerly called one's &quot;good conscience,&quot; that long, respectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.&#x2014;Ah! if you only knew how soon, so very soon&#x2014;it will be different!&#013;&#013;215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our &quot;firmament,&quot; are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal&#x2014;and there are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.&#013;&#013;216. To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:&#x2014;we learn to DESPISE when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude&#x2014;is opposed to our taste nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste, including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the music in our conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.&#013;&#013;217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment! They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us (or even with REGARD to us)&#x2014;they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our &quot;friends.&quot;&#x2014;Blessed are the forgetful: for they &quot;get the better&quot; even of their blunders.&#013;&#013;218. The psychologists of France&#x2014;and where else are there still psychologists nowadays?&#x2014;have never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasure&#x2014;namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle-class in its best moments&#x2014;subtler even than the understanding of its victims:&#x2014;a repeated proof that &quot;instinct&quot; is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the &quot;rule&quot; in its struggle with the &quot;exception&quot;: there you have a spectacle fit for Gods and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on &quot;good people,&quot; on the &quot;homo bonae voluntatis,&quot; ON YOURSELVES!&#013;&#013;219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING subtle&#x2014;malice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the &quot;equality of all before God,&quot; and almost NEED the belief in God for this purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found. If any one were to say to them &quot;A lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man&quot;&#x2014;it would make them furious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the &quot;merely moral&quot; man, after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among things&#x2014;and not only among men.&#013;&#013;220. Now that the praise of the &quot;disinterested person&quot; is so popular one must&#x2014;probably not without some danger&#x2014;get an idea of WHAT people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men&#x2014;including the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely &quot;uninteresting&quot; to the average man&#x2014;if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act &quot;disinterestedly.&quot; There have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that &quot;disinterested&quot; action is very interesting and &quot;interested&quot; action, provided that... &quot;And love?&quot;&#x2014;What! Even an action for love's sake shall be &quot;unegoistic&quot;? But you fools&#x2014;! &quot;And the praise of the self-sacrificer?&quot;&#x2014;But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it&#x2014;perhaps something from himself for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself &quot;more.&quot; But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer. And after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force with her.&#013;&#013;221. &quot;It sometimes happens,&quot; said a moralistic pedant and trifle-retailer, &quot;that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not, however, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense. In short, the question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction under the mask of philanthropy&#x2014;and precisely a seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience&#x2014;until they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what is right for one is proper for another.'&quot;&#x2014;So said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality? But one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONE'S OWN side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.&#013;&#013;222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays&#x2014;and, if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached&#x2014;let the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all the noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on the increase for a century (the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame d'Epinay)&#x2014;IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with himself&#x2014;this is perfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him only &quot;to suffer with his fellows.&quot;&#013;&#013;223. The hybrid European&#x2014;a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in all&#x2014;absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him properly&#x2014;he changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style, and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of &quot;nothing suiting&quot; us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or &quot;national,&quot; in moribus et artibus: it does not &quot;clothe us&quot;! But the &quot;spirit,&quot; especially the &quot;historical spirit,&quot; profits even by this desperation: once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested, put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied&#x2014;we are the first studious age in puncto of &quot;costumes,&quot; I mean as concerns morals, articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the most spiritual festival&#x2014;laughter and arrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of the world's history and as God's Merry-Andrews,&#x2014;perhaps, though nothing else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a future!&#013;&#013;224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a community, or an individual has lived, the &quot;divining instinct&quot; for the relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces),&#x2014;this historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and races&#x2014;it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us &quot;modern souls&quot;; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire, we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity, the &quot;historical sense&quot; implies almost the sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily appropriate&#x2014;whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire, a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could not become their prey&#x2014;and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian of the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but we&#x2014;accept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English populace in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way, enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower quarters of the town. That as men of the &quot;historical sense&quot; we have our virtues, is not to be disputed:&#x2014;we are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very patient, very complaisant&#x2014;but with all this we are perhaps not very &quot;tasteful.&quot; Let us finally confess it, that what is most difficult for us men of the &quot;historical sense&quot; to grasp, feel, taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,&#x2014;when a super-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let the reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-barbarians&#x2014;and are only in OUR highest bliss when we&#x2014;ARE IN MOST DANGER.&#013;&#013;225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism, all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and naivetes, which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist's conscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy. Sympathy for you!&#x2014;to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand it: it is not sympathy for social &quot;distress,&quot; for &quot;society&quot; with its sick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling, vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power&#x2014;they call it &quot;freedom.&quot; OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:&#x2014;we see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist it,&#x2014;when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. You want, if possible&#x2014;and there is not a more foolish &quot;if possible&quot;&#x2014;TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?&#x2014;it really seems that WE would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been! Well-being, as you understand it&#x2014;is certainly not a goal; it seems to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible&#x2014;and makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline of suffering, of GREAT suffering&#x2014;know ye not that it is only THIS discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto? The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy, its shuddering in view of rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and whatever depth, mystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has been bestowed upon the soul&#x2014;has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering? In man CREATURE and CREATOR are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh day&#x2014;do ye understand this contrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the &quot;creature in man&quot; applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged, stretched, roasted, annealed, refined&#x2014;to that which must necessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathy&#x2014;do ye not understand what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it resists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and enervation?&#x2014;So it is sympathy AGAINST sympathy!&#x2014;But to repeat it once more, there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.&#013;&#013;226. WE IMMORALISTS.&#x2014;This world with which WE are concerned, in which we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of &quot;almost&quot; in every respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender&#x2014;yes, it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We are woven into a strong net and garment of duties, and CANNOT disengage ourselves&#x2014;precisely here, we are &quot;men of duty,&quot; even we! Occasionally, it is true, we dance in our &quot;chains&quot; and betwixt our &quot;swords&quot;; it is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. But do what we will, fools and appearances say of us: &quot;These are men WITHOUT duty,&quot;&#x2014;we have always fools and appearances against us!&#013;&#013;227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid ourselves, we free spirits&#x2014;well, we will labour at it with all our perversity and love, and not tire of &quot;perfecting&quot; ourselves in OUR virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy seriousness! And if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let us remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us:&#x2014;our disgust at the clumsy and undefined, our &quot;NITIMUR IN VETITUM,&quot; our love of adventure, our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised, intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the future&#x2014;let us go with all our &quot;devils&quot; to the help of our &quot;God&quot;! It is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! They will say: &quot;Their 'honesty'&#x2014;that is their devilry, and nothing else!&quot; What does it matter! And even if they were right&#x2014;have not all Gods hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils? And after all, what do we know of ourselves? And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE CALLED? (It is a question of names.) And how many spirits we harbour? Our honesty, we free spirits&#x2014;let us be careful lest it become our vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our stupidity! Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; &quot;stupid to the point of sanctity,&quot; they say in Russia,&#x2014;let us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! Is not life a hundred times too short for us&#x2014;to bore ourselves? One would have to believe in eternal life in order to...&#013;&#013;228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliances&#x2014;and that &quot;virtue,&quot; in my opinion, has been MORE injured by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the same time, however, I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. It is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner&#x2014;that CALAMITY might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one MUST read them), concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the &quot;general utility,&quot; or &quot;the happiness of the greatest number,&quot;&#x2014;no! the happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all means, to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous, conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the &quot;general welfare&quot; is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a nostrum,&#x2014;that what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian Englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one cannot think highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE them, as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;    Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling,&#013;    &quot;Longer&#x2014;better,&quot; aye revealing,&#013;&#013;    Stiffer aye in head and knee;&#013;    Unenraptured, never jesting,&#013;    Mediocre everlasting,&#013;&#013;    SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT!&#013;229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the &quot;cruel wild beast,&quot; the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner ages&#x2014;that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again. I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let others capture it again and give it so much &quot;milk of pious sentiment&quot; [FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner.&#x2014;One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errors&#x2014;as, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedy&#x2014;may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call &quot;higher culture&quot; is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY&#x2014;this is my thesis; the &quot;wild beast&quot; has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only been&#x2014;transfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne who, with unhinged will, &quot;undergoes&quot; the performance of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;&#x2014;what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe &quot;cruelty.&quot; Here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in causing one's own suffering&#x2014;and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.&#x2014;Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his heart:&#x2014;he forces it to say Nay, where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,&#x2014;even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.&#013;&#013;230. Perhaps what I have said here about a &quot;fundamental will of the spirit&quot; may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a word of explanation.&#x2014;That imperious something which is popularly called &quot;the spirit,&quot; wishes to be master internally and externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will. Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the &quot;outside world.&quot; Its object thereby is the incorporation of new &quot;experiences,&quot; the assortment of new things in the old arrangements&#x2014;in short, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased power&#x2014;is its object. This same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its &quot;digestive power,&quot; to speak figuratively (and in fact &quot;the spirit&quot; resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the misshapen, the beautified&#x2014;an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them&#x2014;the constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security therein&#x2014;it is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best protected and concealed!&#x2014;COUNTER TO this propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outside&#x2014;for every outside is a cloak&#x2014;there operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words. He will say: &quot;There is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit&quot;: let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps our &quot;extravagant honesty&quot; were talked about, whispered about, and glorified&#x2014;we free, VERY free spirits&#x2014;and some day perhaps SUCH will actually be our&#x2014;posthumous glory! Meanwhile&#x2014;for there is plenty of time until then&#x2014;we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. They are beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful&#x2014;there is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride. But we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In effect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: &quot;Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!&quot;&#x2014;this may be a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question differently: &quot;Why knowledge at all?&quot; Every one will ask us about this. And thus pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have not found and cannot find any better answer....&#013;&#013;231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not merely &quot;conserve&quot;&#x2014;as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our souls, quite &quot;down below,&quot; there is certainly something unteachable, a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable &quot;I am this&quot;; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for instance, but can only learn fully&#x2014;he can only follow to the end what is &quot;fixed&quot; about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they are henceforth called &quot;convictions.&quot; Later on&#x2014;one sees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we ourselves ARE&#x2014;or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody, our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite &quot;down below.&quot;&#x2014;In view of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about &quot;woman as she is,&quot; provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merely&#x2014;MY truths.&#013;&#013;232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to enlighten men about &quot;woman as she is&quot;&#x2014;THIS is one of the worst developments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion concealed&#x2014;study only woman's behaviour towards children!&#x2014;which has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the &quot;eternally tedious in woman&quot;&#x2014;she has plenty of it!&#x2014;is allowed to venture forth! if she begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:&#x2014;with medical explicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair, men's gift&#x2014;we remained therewith &quot;among ourselves&quot;; and in the end, in view of all that women write about &quot;woman,&quot; we may well have considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment about herself&#x2014;and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new ORNAMENT for herself&#x2014;I believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine?&#x2014;why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth&#x2014;what does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth&#x2014;her great art is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it not true that on the whole &quot;woman&quot; has hitherto been most despised by woman herself, and not at all by us?&#x2014;We men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in politicis!&#x2014;and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.&#013;&#013;233. It betrays corruption of the instincts&#x2014;apart from the fact that it betrays bad taste&#x2014;when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby in favour of &quot;woman as she is.&quot; Among men, these are the three comical women as they are&#x2014;nothing more!&#x2014;and just the best involuntary counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.&#013;&#013;234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed! Woman does not understand what food means, and she insists on being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature, she should certainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most important physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession of the healing art! Through bad female cooks&#x2014;through the entire lack of reason in the kitchen&#x2014;the development of mankind has been longest retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little better. A word to High School girls.&#013;&#013;235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly crystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de Lambert to her son: &quot;MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES, QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR&quot;&#x2014;the motherliest and wisest remark, by the way, that was ever addressed to a son.&#013;&#013;236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and Goethe believed about woman&#x2014;the former when he sang, &quot;ELLA GUARDAVA SUSO, ED IO IN LEI,&quot; and the latter when he interpreted it, &quot;the eternally feminine draws us ALOFT&quot;; for THIS is just what she believes of the eternally masculine.&#013;&#013;237. SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN&#013;&#013;How the longest ennui flees, When a man comes to our knees!&#013;&#013;Age, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aid.&#013;&#013;Sombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame&#x2014;discreet.&#013;&#013;Whom I thank when in my bliss? God!&#x2014;and my good tailoress!&#013;&#013;Young, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth roam.&#013;&#013;Noble title, leg that's fine, Man as well: Oh, were HE mine!&#013;&#013;Speech in brief and sense in mass&#x2014;Slippery for the jenny-ass!&#013;&#013;237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating&#x2014;but as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.&#013;&#013;238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of &quot;man and woman,&quot; to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot&#x2014;shallow in instinct!&#x2014;may generally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove too &quot;short&quot; for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable property, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein&#x2014;he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of Asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asia&#x2014;who, as is well known, with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time of Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards woman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!&#013;&#013;239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men as at present&#x2014;this belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to old age&#x2014;what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who &quot;unlearns to fear&quot; sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture forward when the fear-inspiring quality in man&#x2014;or more definitely, the MAN in man&#x2014;is no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby&#x2014;woman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: &quot;woman as clerkess&quot; is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be &quot;master,&quot; and inscribes &quot;progress&quot; of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and the &quot;emancipation of woman,&quot; insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman&#x2014;who is always a sensible woman&#x2014;might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even &quot;to the book,&quot; where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):&#x2014;what does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which &quot;man&quot; in Europe, European &quot;manliness,&quot; suffers,&#x2014;who would like to lower woman to &quot;general culture,&quot; indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;&#x2014;almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of bearing robust children. They wish to &quot;cultivate&quot; her in general still more, and intend, as they say, to make the &quot;weaker sex&quot; STRONG by culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the &quot;cultivating&quot; of mankind and his weakening&#x2014;that is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL&#x2014;have always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank their force of will&#x2014;and not their schoolmasters&#x2014;for their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more &quot;natural&quot; than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, &quot;woman,&quot; is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it delights&#x2014;What? And all that is now to be at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once more become &quot;history&quot;&#x2014;an immense stupidity might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed beneath it&#x2014;no! only an &quot;idea,&quot; a &quot;modern idea&quot;!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER VIII. PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES&#013;240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living, in order that it may be understood:&#x2014;it is an honour to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse&#x2014;it has fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight&#x2014;the most manifold delight,&#x2014;of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: &quot;It is part of my intention&quot;; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of decadence&#x2014;which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of music expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow&#x2014;THEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.&#013;&#013;241. We &quot;good Europeans,&quot; we also have hours when we allow ourselves a warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow views&#x2014;I have just given an example of it&#x2014;hours of national excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours&#x2014;in a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed and strength with which they digest and &quot;change their material.&quot; Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to &quot;good Europeanism.&quot; And while digressing on this possibility, I happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriots&#x2014;they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder. &quot;HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student,&quot; said the one&#x2014;&quot;he is still innocent. But what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on their belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and power, they call 'great'&#x2014;what does it matter that we more prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity;&#x2014;supposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially politics-practising nations;&#x2014;supposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'&#x2014;what! a statesman who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman would be GREAT, would he?&quot;&#x2014;&quot;Undoubtedly!&quot; replied the other old patriot vehemently, &quot;otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad at its commencement!&quot;&#x2014;&quot;Misuse of words!&quot; cried his interlocutor, contradictorily&#x2014;&quot;strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!&quot;&#x2014;The old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their &quot;truths&quot; in each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a nation&#x2014;namely, in the deepening of another.&#013;&#013;242. Whether we call it &quot;civilization,&quot; or &quot;humanising,&quot; or &quot;progress,&quot; which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in Europe&#x2014;behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands on soul and body,&#x2014;that is to say, the slow emergence of an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth&#x2014;the still-raging storm and stress of &quot;national sentiment&quot; pertains to it, and also the anarchism which is appearing at present&#x2014;this process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; would least care to reckon. The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take place&#x2014;a useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious man&#x2014;are in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been before&#x2014;owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS&#x2014;taking the word in all its meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.&#013;&#013;243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do like the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!&#013;&#013;244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans &quot;deep&quot; by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses &quot;smartness&quot; in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something different and worse&#x2014;and something from which, thank God, we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the German soul.&#x2014;The German soul is above all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would embolden himself to assert: &quot;Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,&quot; would make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the &quot;people of the centre&quot; in every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:&#x2014;they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that the question: &quot;What is German?&quot; never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well enough: &quot;We are known,&quot; they cried jubilantly to him&#x2014;but Sand also thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations,&#x2014;but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the Germans?&#x2014;But about many things around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence&#x2014;probably he had good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the &quot;Wars of Independence&quot; that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was the French Revolution,&#x2014;the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED his &quot;Faust,&quot; and indeed the whole problem of &quot;man,&quot; was the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as &quot;Indulgence towards its own and others' weaknesses.&quot; Was he wrong? it is characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is &quot;deep&quot;. The German himself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is &quot;developing himself&quot;. &quot;Development&quot; is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas,&#x2014;a ruling idea, which, together with German beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music). &quot;Good-natured and spiteful&quot;&#x2014;such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one wishes to see the &quot;German soul&quot; demonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish indifference to &quot;taste&quot;! How the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets &quot;done&quot; with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating &quot;digestion.&quot; And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so the German loves &quot;frankness&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;; it is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!&#x2014;This confidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can &quot;still achieve much&quot;! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyes&#x2014;and other countries immediately confound him with his dressing-gown!&#x2014;I meant to say that, let &quot;German depth&quot; be what it will&#x2014;among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it&#x2014;we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian &quot;smartness,&quot; and Berlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it might even be&#x2014;profound to do so! Finally, we should do honour to our name&#x2014;we are not called the &quot;TIUSCHE VOLK&quot; (deceptive people) for nothing....&#013;&#013;245. The &quot;good old&quot; time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart&#x2014;how happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his &quot;good company,&quot; his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be over with it!&#x2014;but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,&#x2014;the same light in which Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!&#x2014;Whatever German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber&#x2014;but what do WE care nowadays for &quot;Freischutz&quot; and &quot;Oberon&quot;! Or Marschner's &quot;Hans Heiling&quot; and &quot;Vampyre&quot;! Or even Wagner's &quot;Tannhauser&quot;! That is extinct, although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first&#x2014;he was the last that founded a school,&#x2014;do we not now regard it as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism of Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the &quot;Saxon Switzerland&quot; of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)&#x2014;his MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity&#x2014;doubly dangerous among Germans&#x2014;for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE&#x2014;this Schumann was already merely a GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.&#013;&#013;246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call a &quot;book&quot;! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is ART in every good sentence&#x2014;art which must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement&#x2014;who among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language? After all, one just &quot;has no ear for it&quot;; and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.&#x2014;These were my thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave&#x2014;he counts on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.&#013;&#013;247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time. In antiquity when a man read&#x2014;which was seldom enough&#x2014;he read something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period;&#x2014;WE have really no right to the BIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics&#x2014;they thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical discourse&#x2014;that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost everything else is merely &quot;literature&quot;&#x2014;something which has not grown in Germany, and therefore has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the Bible has done.&#013;&#013;248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are those on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the secret task of forming, maturing, and perfecting&#x2014;the Greeks, for instance, were a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life&#x2014;like the Jews, the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the Germans?&#x2014;nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for foreign races (for such as &quot;let themselves be fructified&quot;), and withal imperious, like everything conscious of being full of generative force, and consequently empowered &quot;by the grace of God.&quot; These two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand each other&#x2014;like man and woman.&#013;&#013;249. Every nation has its own &quot;Tartuffery,&quot; and calls that its virtue.&#x2014;One does not know&#x2014;cannot know, the best that is in one.&#013;&#013;250. What Europe owes to the Jews?&#x2014;Many things, good and bad, and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral questionableness&#x2014;and consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring, and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life, in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening sky, now glows&#x2014;perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among the spectators and philosophers, are&#x2014;grateful to the Jews.&#013;&#013;251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbances&#x2014;in short, slight attacks of stupidity&#x2014;pass over the spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day Germans there is alternately the anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the Christian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me&#x2014;the first symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen to the following:&#x2014;I have never yet met a German who was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment;&#x2014;on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this quantity of &quot;Jew&quot;&#x2014;as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:&#x2014;that is the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen and according to which one must act. &quot;Let no more Jews come in! And shut the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!&quot;&#x2014;thus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like nowadays to label as vices&#x2014;owing above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before &quot;modern ideas&quot;, they alter only, WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes its conquest&#x2014;as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterday&#x2014;namely, according to the principle, &quot;as slowly as possible&quot;! A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present called a &quot;nation&quot; in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such &quot;nations&quot; should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and hostility! It is certain that the Jews, if they desired&#x2014;or if they were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wish&#x2014;COULD now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the &quot;wandering Jew&quot;,&#x2014;and one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and intellectuality&#x2014;sadly lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying&#x2014;for both of which the country in question has now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the &quot;European problem,&quot; as I understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.&#013;&#013;252. They are not a philosophical race&#x2014;the English: Bacon represents an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a &quot;philosopher&quot; for more than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself; it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, &quot;JE MEPRISE LOCKE&quot;; in the struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each other as only brothers will do.&#x2014;What is lacking in England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyle&#x2014;real POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in short, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity&#x2014;they NEED its discipline for &quot;moralizing&quot; and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German&#x2014;is for that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote&#x2014;the finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the &quot;Salvation Army&quot;), a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of &quot;humanity&quot; to which they can be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for &quot;music.&quot; Listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKING&#x2014;in no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing! But I ask too much...&#013;&#013;253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds, because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:&#x2014;one is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of respectable but mediocre Englishmen&#x2014;I may mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer&#x2014;begins to gain the ascendancy in the middle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are &quot;the rules.&quot; After all, they have more to do than merely to perceive:&#x2014;in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person;&#x2014;while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.&#x2014;Finally, let it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity, brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence.&#013;&#013;What is called &quot;modern ideas,&quot; or &quot;the ideas of the eighteenth century,&quot; or &quot;French ideas&quot;&#x2014;that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind rose up with profound disgust&#x2014;is of English origin, there is no doubt about it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas, their best soldiers, and likewise, alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS; for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; the AME FRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief. One must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and appearances: the European NOBLESSE&#x2014;of sentiment, taste, and manners, taking the word in every high sense&#x2014;is the work and invention of FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas&#x2014;is ENGLAND'S work and invention.&#013;&#013;254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual and refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but one must know how to find this &quot;France of taste.&quot; He who belongs to it keeps himself well concealed:&#x2014;they may be a small number in whom it lives and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to conceal themselves.&#013;&#013;They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic BOURGEOIS. In fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls in the foreground&#x2014;it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist intellectual Germanizing&#x2014;and a still greater inability to do so! In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism, Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine&#x2014;the FIRST of living historians&#x2014;exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it &quot;Wagnerite&quot;; one can safely predict that beforehand,&#x2014;it is already taking place sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for devotion to &quot;form,&quot; for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along with numerous others, has been invented:&#x2014;such capacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the &quot;small number,&quot; it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.&#x2014;The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany. The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call the Germans &quot;naive&quot; on that account give them commendation for a defect. (As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of German intercourse,&#x2014;and as the most successful expression of genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe, in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and discoverer thereof:&#x2014;it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him&#x2014;this strange Epicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of France).&#x2014;There is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of blood&#x2014;our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say &quot;high politics,&quot; has with great resolution been prescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet hope).&#x2014;There is also still in France a pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the South&#x2014;the born Midlanders, the &quot;good Europeans.&quot; For them BIZET has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction,&#x2014;who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.&#013;&#013;255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music. Suppose a person loves the South as I love it&#x2014;as a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign existence believing in itself&#x2014;well, such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky&#x2014;a super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives.&#013;&#013;256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policy&#x2014;owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong to the &quot;fatherlands&quot;&#x2014;they only rested from themselves when they became &quot;patriots.&quot; I think of such men as Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and intimately related to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art&#x2014;whither? into a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great seekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears&#x2014;the first artists of universal literary culture&#x2014;for the most part even themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for EXPRESSION &quot;at any cost&quot;&#x2014;I specially mention Delacroix, the nearest related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men, Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action&#x2014;think of Balzac, for instance,&#x2014;unrestrained workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);&#x2014;on the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their century&#x2014;and it is the century of the MASSES&#x2014;the conception &quot;higher man.&quot;... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive time&#x2014;and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done&#x2014;owing to the circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the French;&#x2014;perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when&#x2014;anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics&#x2014;he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.&#x2014;That these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean&#x2014;what I mean COUNTER TO the &quot;last Wagner&quot; and his Parsifal music:&#x2014;&#013;&#013;&#x2014;Is this our mode?&#x2014;From German heart came this vexed ululating? From German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly hand-dilation, This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering, falling, shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling? This sly nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured heaven-o'erspringing?&#x2014;Is this our mode?&#x2014;Think well!&#x2014;ye still wait for admission&#x2014;For what ye hear is ROME&#x2014;ROME'S FAITH BY INTUITION!&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;CHAPTER IX. WHAT IS NOBLE?&#013;257. EVERY elevation of the type &quot;man,&quot; has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be&#x2014;a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a distance&#x2014;that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type &quot;man,&quot; the continued &quot;self-surmounting of man,&quot; to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type &quot;man&quot;): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED! Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement, the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical power&#x2014;they were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies the same as &quot;more complete beasts&quot;).&#013;&#013;258. Corruption&#x2014;as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called &quot;life,&quot; is convulsed&#x2014;is something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:&#x2014;it was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof&#x2014;that it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants in Java&#x2014;they are called Sipo Matador,&#x2014;which encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness.&#013;&#013;259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation, and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is&#x2014;namely, a Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation;&#x2014;but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the organization within which, as was previously supposed, the individuals treat each other as equal&#x2014;it takes place in every healthy aristocracy&#x2014;must itself, if it be a living and not a dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy&#x2014;not owing to any morality or immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of society in which &quot;the exploiting character&quot; is to be absent&#x2014;that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions. &quot;Exploitation&quot; does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to Life&#x2014;Granting that as a theory this is a novelty&#x2014;as a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves!&#013;&#013;260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,&#x2014;I would at once add, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close juxtaposition&#x2014;even in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled&#x2014;or among the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception &quot;good,&quot; it is the exalted, proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; means practically the same as &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;despicable&quot;,&#x2014;the antithesis &quot;good&quot; and &quot;EVIL&quot; is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:&#x2014;it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. &quot;We truthful ones&quot;&#x2014;the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, &quot;Why have sympathetic actions been praised?&quot; The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: &quot;What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;&quot; he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:&#x2014;the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not&#x2014;or scarcely&#x2014;out of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard. &quot;Wotan placed a hard heart in my breast,&quot; says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: &quot;He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one.&quot; The noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards &quot;selflessness,&quot; belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the &quot;warm heart.&quot;&#x2014;It is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The profound reverence for age and for tradition&#x2014;all law rests on this double reverence,&#x2014;the belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if, reversely, men of &quot;modern ideas&quot; believe almost instinctively in &quot;progress&quot; and the &quot;future,&quot; and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these &quot;ideas&quot; has complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or &quot;as the heart desires,&quot; and in any case &quot;beyond good and evil&quot;: it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge&#x2014;both only within the circle of equals,&#x2014;artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance&#x2014;in fact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to unearth and disclose.&#x2014;It is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything &quot;good&quot; that is there honoured&#x2014;he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility. Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;:&#x2014;power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the &quot;evil&quot; man arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the &quot;good&quot; man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade of depreciation&#x2014;it may be slight and well-intentioned&#x2014;at last attaches itself to the &quot;good&quot; man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words &quot;good&quot; and &quot;stupid.&quot;&#x2014;A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.&#x2014;Hence we can understand without further detail why love AS A PASSION&#x2014;it is our European specialty&#x2014;must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the &quot;gai saber,&quot; to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself.&#013;&#013;261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possess&#x2014;and consequently also do not &quot;deserve,&quot;&#x2014;and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for instance: &quot;I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as I rate it:&#x2014;that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also 'modesty').&quot; Or he will even say: &quot;For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:&#x2014;all this, however, is not vanity.&quot; The man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:&#x2014;not being at all accustomed to fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a &quot;good&quot; opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to &quot;think well&quot; of themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it&#x2014;and in the phenomenon of &quot;vanity&quot; this older propensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.&#x2014;It is &quot;the slave&quot; in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness&#x2014;and how much of the &quot;slave&quot; is still left in woman, for instance!&#x2014;which seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not called them forth.&#x2014;And to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.&#013;&#013;262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour, the super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of &quot;justice.&quot; A type with few, but very marked features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as a condition of existence&#x2014;if it would continue, it can only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations, whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms, which strive with one another &quot;for sun and light,&quot; and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:&#x2014;it is now &quot;out of date,&quot; it is getting &quot;out of date.&quot; The dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the &quot;individual&quot; stands out, and is obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing but new &quot;Whys,&quot; nothing but new &quot;Hows,&quot; no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves&#x2014;they will be the men of the future, the sole survivors; &quot;be like them! become mediocre!&quot; is now the only morality which has still a significance, which still obtains a hearing.&#x2014;But it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it desires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly love&#x2014;it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!&#013;&#013;263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand&#x2014;it is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary, in the so-called cultured classes, the believers in &quot;modern ideas,&quot; nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.&#013;&#013;264. It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith&#x2014;for their &quot;God,&quot;&#x2014;as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vaunting&#x2014;the three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all times&#x2014;such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.&#x2014;And what else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our very democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, &quot;education&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; MUST be essentially the art of deceiving&#x2014;deceiving with regard to origin, with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educator who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out constantly to his pupils: &quot;Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you are!&quot;&#x2014;even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what results? &quot;Plebeianism&quot; USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horace's &quot;Epistles,&quot; I. x. 24.]&#013;&#013;265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as &quot;we,&quot; other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things:&#x2014;if he sought a designation for it he would say: &quot;It is justice itself.&quot; He acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himself&#x2014;in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse with his equals&#x2014;every star is a similar egoist; he honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. The notion of &quot;favour&quot; has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him here: in general, he looks &quot;aloft&quot; unwillingly&#x2014;he looks either FORWARD, horizontally and deliberately, or downwards&#x2014;HE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A HEIGHT.&#013;&#013;266. &quot;One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR himself.&quot;&#x2014;Goethe to Rath Schlosser.&#013;&#013;267. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children: &quot;SIAO-SIN&quot; (&quot;MAKE THY HEART SMALL&quot;). This is the essentially fundamental tendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancient Greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans of today&#x2014;in this respect alone we should immediately be &quot;distasteful&quot; to him.&#013;&#013;268. What, after all, is ignobleness?&#x2014;Words are vocal symbols for ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that &quot;understands itself&quot;&#x2014;namely, a nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidly&#x2014;the history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another in danger&#x2014;that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of the other. (The fear of the &quot;eternal misunderstanding&quot;: that is the good genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt them&#x2014;and NOT some Schopenhauerian &quot;genius of the species&quot;!) Whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of command&#x2014;these decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's estimates of value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious&#x2014;to the IGNOBLE&#x2014;!&#013;&#013;269. The more a psychologist&#x2014;a born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner&#x2014;turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner &quot;desperateness&quot; of higher men, this eternal &quot;too late!&quot; in every sense&#x2014;may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction&#x2014;of his &quot;going to ruin&quot; himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness&#x2014;from what his &quot;business&quot;&#x2014;has laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVED&#x2014;or he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence&#x2014;reverence for &quot;great men&quot; and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the &quot;God&quot; was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS has always been the greatest liar&#x2014;and the &quot;work&quot; itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the &quot;work&quot; of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED to have created it; the &quot;great men,&quot; as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars&#x2014;the people then call them idealists,&#x2014;often struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour &quot;faith as it is&quot; out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:&#x2014;what a TORMENT these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman&#x2014;who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers&#x2014;that THEY have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do EVERYTHING&#x2014;it is the SUPERSTITION peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is&#x2014;he finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!&#x2014;It is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those who WOULD NOT love him&#x2014;and that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire CAPACITY for love&#x2014;who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such KNOWLEDGE about love&#x2014;SEEKS for death!&#x2014;But why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so.&#013;&#013;270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has suffered deeply&#x2014;it almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men can suffer&#x2014;the chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly imbued and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than the shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with, and &quot;at home&quot; in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which &quot;YOU know nothing&quot;!&#x2014;this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this pride of the elect of knowledge, of the &quot;initiated,&quot; of the almost sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all that is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble: it separates.&#x2014;One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound. They are &quot;gay men&quot; who make use of gaiety, because they are misunderstood on account of it&#x2014;they WISH to be misunderstood. There are &quot;scientific minds&quot; who make use of science, because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to the conclusion that a person is superficial&#x2014;they WISH to mislead to a false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of Hamlet&#x2014;the case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.&#x2014;From which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence &quot;for the mask,&quot; and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.&#013;&#013;271. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense and grade of purity. What does it matter about all their honesty and reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual good-will: the fact still remains&#x2014;they &quot;cannot smell each other!&quot; The highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just holiness&#x2014;the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. Any kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath, any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of &quot;affliction&quot; into clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:&#x2014;just as much as such a tendency DISTINGUISHES&#x2014;it is a noble tendency&#x2014;it also SEPARATES.&#x2014;The pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human, all-too-human. And there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as impurity, as filth.&#013;&#013;272. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to share our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the exercise of them, among our DUTIES.&#013;&#013;273. A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and hindrance&#x2014;or as a temporary resting-place. His peculiar lofty BOUNTY to his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and dominates. Impatience, and the consciousness of being always condemned to comedy up to that time&#x2014;for even strife is a comedy, and conceals the end, as every means does&#x2014;spoil all intercourse for him; this kind of man is acquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it.&#013;&#013;274. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT.&#x2014;Happy chances are necessary, and many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in whom the solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action, or &quot;break forth,&quot; as one might say&#x2014;at the right moment. On an average it DOES NOT happen; and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they wait in vain. Occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late&#x2014;the chance which gives &quot;permission&quot; to take action&#x2014;when their best youth, and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many a one, just as he &quot;sprang up,&quot; has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! &quot;It is too late,&quot; he has said to himself&#x2014;and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever useless.&#x2014;In the domain of genius, may not the &quot;Raphael without hands&quot; (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the exception, but the rule?&#x2014;Perhaps genius is by no means so rare: but rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize over the [GREEK INSERTED HERE], &quot;the right time&quot;&#x2014;in order to take chance by the forelock!&#013;&#013;275. He who does not WISH to see the height of a man, looks all the more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground&#x2014;and thereby betrays himself.&#013;&#013;276. In all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must be greater, the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its existence.&#x2014;In a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not so in man.&#x2014;&#013;&#013;277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he&#x2014;began to build. The eternal, fatal &quot;Too late!&quot; The melancholia of everything COMPLETED&#x2014;!&#013;&#013;278.&#x2014;Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without scorn, without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every depth&#x2014;what did it seek down there?&#x2014;with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou? what hast thou done? Rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every one&#x2014;refresh thyself! And whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases thee? What will serve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have I offer thee! &quot;To refresh me? To refresh me? Oh, thou prying one, what sayest thou! But give me, I pray thee&#x2014;-&quot; What? what? Speak out! &quot;Another mask! A second mask!&quot;&#013;&#013;279. Men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy: they have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and strangle it, out of jealousy&#x2014;ah, they know only too well that it will flee from them!&#013;&#013;280. &quot;Bad! Bad! What? Does he not&#x2014;go back?&quot; Yes! But you misunderstand him when you complain about it. He goes back like every one who is about to make a great spring.&#013;&#013;281.&#x2014;&quot;Will people believe it of me? But I insist that they believe it of me: I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without delight in 'the subject,' ready to digress from 'myself,' and always without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the POSSIBILITY of self-knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of 'direct knowledge' which theorists allow themselves:&#x2014;this matter of fact is almost the most certain thing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.&#x2014;Is there perhaps some enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own teeth.&#x2014;Perhaps it betrays the species to which I belong?&#x2014;but not to myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me.&quot;&#013;&#013;282.&#x2014;&quot;But what has happened to you?&quot;&#x2014;&quot;I do not know,&quot; he said, hesitatingly; &quot;perhaps the Harpies have flown over my table.&quot;&#x2014;It sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man becomes suddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table, shrieks, raves, and shocks everybody&#x2014;and finally withdraws, ashamed, and raging at himself&#x2014;whither? for what purpose? To famish apart? To suffocate with his memories?&#x2014;To him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul, and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the danger will always be great&#x2014;nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so. Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does not like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger and thirst&#x2014;or, should he nevertheless finally &quot;fall to,&quot; of sudden nausea.&#x2014;We have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong; and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult to nourish, know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates&#x2014;the AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.&#013;&#013;283. If one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the same time a noble self-control, to praise only where one DOES NOT agree&#x2014;otherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is contrary to good taste:&#x2014;a self-control, to be sure, which offers excellent opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING. To be able to allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality, one must not live among intellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement&#x2014;or one will have to pay dearly for it!&#x2014;&quot;He praises me, THEREFORE he acknowledges me to be right&quot;&#x2014;this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and friendship.&#013;&#013;284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond... To have, or not to have, one's emotions, one's For and Against, according to choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them as upon horses, and often as upon asses:&#x2014;for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve one's three hundred foregrounds; also one's black spectacles: for there are circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our &quot;motives.&quot; And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice, politeness. And to remain master of one's four virtues, courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us, as a sublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of man and man&#x2014;&quot;in society&quot;&#x2014;it must be unavoidably impure. All society makes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime&#x2014;&quot;commonplace.&quot;&#013;&#013;285. The greatest events and thoughts&#x2014;the greatest thoughts, however, are the greatest events&#x2014;are longest in being comprehended: the generations which are contemporary with them do not EXPERIENCE such events&#x2014;they live past them. Something happens there as in the realm of stars. The light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and before it has arrived man DENIES&#x2014;that there are stars there. &quot;How many centuries does a mind require to be understood?&quot;&#x2014;that is also a standard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith, such as is necessary for mind and for star.&#013;&#013;286. &quot;Here is the prospect free, the mind exalted.&quot; [FOOTNOTE: Goethe's &quot;Faust,&quot; Part II, Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.]&#x2014;But there is a reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free prospect&#x2014;but looks DOWNWARDS.&#013;&#013;287. What is noble? What does the word &quot;noble&quot; still mean for us nowadays? How does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which everything is rendered opaque and leaden?&#x2014;It is not his actions which establish his claim&#x2014;actions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable; neither is it his &quot;works.&quot; One finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the works, but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of rank&#x2014;to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning&#x2014;it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost.&#x2014;THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF.&#x2014;&#013;&#013;288. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their treacherous eyes&#x2014;as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always comes out at last that they have something which they hide&#x2014;namely, intellect. One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really is&#x2014;which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella,&#x2014;is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for instance, virtue. For as Galiani said, who was obliged to know it: VERTU EST ENTHOUSIASME.&#013;&#013;289. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who has sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear, or a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave&#x2014;it may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine&#x2014;his ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive, which blows chilly upon every passer-by. The recluse does not believe that a philosopher&#x2014;supposing that a philosopher has always in the first place been a recluse&#x2014;ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?&#x2014;indeed, he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have &quot;ultimate and actual&quot; opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every &quot;foundation.&quot; Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy&#x2014;this is a recluse's verdict: &quot;There is something arbitrary in the fact that the PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around; that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper&#x2014;there is also something suspicious in it.&quot; Every philosophy also CONCEALS a philosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is also a MASK.&#013;&#013;290. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: &quot;Ah, why would you also have as hard a time of it as I have?&quot;&#013;&#013;291. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of &quot;art&quot; than is generally believed.&#013;&#013;292. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees, hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on. A philosopher: alas, a being who often runs away from himself, is often afraid of himself&#x2014;but whose curiosity always makes him &quot;come to himself&quot; again.&#013;&#013;293. A man who says: &quot;I like that, I take it for my own, and mean to guard and protect it from every one&quot;; a man who can conduct a case, carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman, punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his sword, and to whom the weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the animals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short, a man who is a MASTER by nature&#x2014;when such a man has sympathy, well! THAT sympathy has value! But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or of those even who preach sympathy! There is nowadays, throughout almost the whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain, and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing, which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks to deck itself out as something superior&#x2014;there is a regular cult of suffering. The UNMANLINESS of that which is called &quot;sympathy&quot; by such groups of visionaries, is always, I believe, the first thing that strikes the eye.&#x2014;One must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet, &quot;GAI SABER&quot; (&quot;gay science,&quot; in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as a protection against it.&#013;&#013;294. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.&#x2014;Despite the philosopher who, as a genuine Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking minds&#x2014;&quot;Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every thinking mind will strive to overcome&quot; (Hobbes),&#x2014;I would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their laughing&#x2014;up to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter. And supposing that Gods also philosophize, which I am strongly inclined to believe, owing to many reasons&#x2014;I have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman-like and new fashion&#x2014;and at the expense of all serious things! Gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot refrain from laughter even in holy matters.&#013;&#013;295. The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can descend into the nether-world of every soul, who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear,&#x2014;not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him more cordially and thoroughly;&#x2014;the genius of the heart, which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited, which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing&#x2014;to lie placid as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;&#x2014;the genius of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate, and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice, and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold, long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will and current, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am I doing, my friends? Of whom am I talking to you? Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name? Unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God and spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again, the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits&#x2014;the last, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I have found no one who could understand what I was then doing. In the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth&#x2014;I, the last disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;&#x2014;among you, my friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further, very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. &quot;Keep that,&quot; he would say, &quot;for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it! I&#x2014;have no reason to cover my nakedness!&quot; One suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?&#x2014;He once said: &quot;Under certain circumstances I love mankind&quot;&#x2014;and referred thereby to Ariadne, who was present; &quot;in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound.&quot;&#x2014;&quot;Stronger, more evil, and more profound?&quot; I asked in horror. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said again, &quot;stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more beautiful&quot;&#x2014;and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;&#x2014;and in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could all of them come to us men for instruction. We men are&#x2014;more human.&#x2014;&#013;&#013;296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts! Not long ago you were so variegated, young and malicious, so full of thorns and secret spices, that you made me sneeze and laugh&#x2014;and now? You have already doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so pathetically honest, so tedious! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with Chinese brush, we immortalisers of things which LEND themselves to writing, what are we alone capable of painting? Alas, only that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour! Alas, only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments! Alas, only birds strayed and fatigued by flight, which now let themselves be captured with the hand&#x2014;with OUR hand! We immortalize what cannot live and fly much longer, things only which are exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your AFTERNOON, you, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated softenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds;&#x2014;but nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved&#x2014;EVIL thoughts!",

        "content": "It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.&#013;&#013;I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.&#013;&#013;But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the streets.&#013;&#013;As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the clothing of many thousands.&#013;&#013;There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.&#013;&#013;The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple, whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.&#013;&#013;I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value.&#013;&#013;I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.&#013;&#013;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee, or a ragoust.&#013;&#013;I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.&#013;&#013;I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 pounds.&#013;&#013;I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the children.&#013;&#013;Infant&#x2019;s flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine months after Lent, than at any other season; therefore, reckoning a year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening the number of Papists among us.&#013;&#013;I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar&#x2019;s child (in which list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another child.&#013;&#013;Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may flay the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.&#013;&#013;As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.&#013;&#013;A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I highly esteem, was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter, to offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the want of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great a number of both sexes in every county being now ready to starve for want of work and service: and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was generally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys, by continual exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would become breeders themselves: and besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project, how well soever intended.&#013;&#013;But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient was put into his head by the famous Psalmanaazor, a native of the island Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty&#x2019;s prime minister of state, and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear at a playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for, the kingdom would not be the worse.&#013;&#013;Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come.&#013;&#013;I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the highest importance.&#013;&#013;For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate.&#013;&#013;Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their landlord&#x2019;s rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a thing unknown.&#013;&#013;Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of a hundred thousand children, from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation&#x2019;s stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture.&#013;&#013;Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year.&#013;&#013;Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they please.&#013;&#013;Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in calf, or sows when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.&#013;&#013;Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel&#x2019;d beef: the propagation of swine&#x2019;s flesh, and improvement in the art of making good bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a well grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor&#x2019;s feast, or any other publick entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of brevity.&#013;&#013;Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty thousand.&#013;&#013;I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and was indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or, I think, ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shopkeepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.&#013;&#013;Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.&#013;&#013;But, as to myself, having been wearied out for many years with offering vain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of success, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which, as it is wholly new, so it hath something solid and real, of no expence and little trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in disobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it.&#013;&#013;After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject any offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent, cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points. First, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly, There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers, with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe, and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they have since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade, the want of common sustenance, with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed for ever.&#013;&#013;I profess in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work, having no other motive than the publick good of my country, by advancing our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and giving some pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can propose to get a single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past child-bearing.",

        "content": "Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH&#013;All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, &#x201c;Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!&#x201d; This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.&#013;&#013;Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.&#013;&#013;The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.&#013;&#013;Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.&#013;&#013;Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.&#013;&#013;For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now don't interrupt,&#x201d; he would beg of her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven&#x2014;who is that moving?&#x2014;eight nine seven, dot and carry seven&#x2014;don't speak, my own&#x2014;and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door&#x2014;quiet, child&#x2014;dot and carry child&#x2014;there, you've done it!&#x2014;did I say nine nine seven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course we can, George,&#x201d; she cried. But she was prejudiced in Wendy's favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Remember mumps,&#x201d; he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again. &#x201c;Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings&#x2014;don't speak&#x2014;measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six&#x2014;don't waggle your finger&#x2014;whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings&#x201d;&#x2014;and so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.&#013;&#013;There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John's footer [in England soccer was called football, &#x201c;footer&#x201d; for short] days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.&#013;&#013;No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.&#013;&#013;He had his position in the city to consider.&#013;&#013;Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him. &#x201c;I know she admires you tremendously, George,&#x201d; Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.&#013;&#013;I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.&#013;&#013;Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.&#013;&#013;Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.&#013;&#013;Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, he is rather cocky,&#x201d; Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had been questioning her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But who is he, my pet?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened. She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; she said to Wendy, &#x201c;he would be grown up by this time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh no, he isn't grown up,&#x201d; Wendy assured her confidently, &#x201c;and he is just my size.&#x201d; She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. &#x201c;Mark my words,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it will blow over.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.&#013;&#013;Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do believe it is that Peter again!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Whatever do you mean, Wendy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,&#x201d; Wendy said, sighing. She was a tidy child.&#013;&#013;She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think he comes in by the window,&#x201d; she said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My love, it is three floors up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My child,&#x201d; the mother cried, &#x201c;why did you not tell me of this before?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I forgot,&#x201d; said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.&#013;&#013;Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.&#013;&#013;But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.&#013;&#013;Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.&#013;&#013;But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.&#013;&#013;On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep.&#013;&#013;All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.&#013;&#013;It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.&#013;&#013;While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.&#013;&#013;The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.&#013;&#013;She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 2 THE SHADOW&#013;Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.&#013;&#013;She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.&#013;&#013;You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.&#013;&#013;Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung it out at the window, meaning &#x201c;He is sure to come back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say: &#x201c;It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!&#013;&#013;The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Of course it was a Friday.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,&#x201d; she used to say afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her, holding her hand.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; Mr. Darling always said, &#x201c;I am responsible for it all. I, George Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA.&#x201d; He had had a classical education.&#013;&#013;They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,&#x201d; Mrs. Darling said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana's bowl,&#x201d; said Mr. Darling.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If only I had pretended to like the medicine,&#x201d; was what Nana's wet eyes said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My liking for parties, George.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My fatal gift of humour, dearest.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought, &#x201c;It's true, it's true, they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse.&#x201d; Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana's eyes.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That fiend!&#x201d; Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.&#013;&#013;They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I won't go to bed,&#x201d; he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, &#x201c;I won't, I won't. Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.&#013;&#013;She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,&#x201d; in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion.&#013;&#013;Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.&#013;&#013;Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.&#013;&#013;Michael had nearly cried. &#x201c;Nobody wants me,&#x201d; he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I so want a third child.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boy or girl?&#x201d; asked Michael, not too hopefully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael's last night in the nursery.&#013;&#013;They go on with their recollections.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?&#x201d; Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.&#013;&#013;Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.&#013;&#013;This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, what is the matter, father dear?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Matter!&#x201d; he yelled; he really yelled. &#x201c;This tie, it will not tie.&#x201d; He became dangerously sarcastic. &#x201c;Not round my neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, &#x201c;I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. &#x201c;Let me try, dear,&#x201d; she said, and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How wildly we romped!&#x201d; says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Our last romp!&#x201d; Mr. Darling groaned.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, 'How did you get to know me, mother?'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I remember!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They were rather sweet, don't you think, George?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;George, Nana is a treasure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, &#x201c;I wonder.&#x201d; It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is nobody I know,&#x201d; he said, examining it carefully, &#x201c;but it does look a scoundrel.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We were still discussing it, you remember,&#x201d; says Mr. Darling, &#x201c;when Nana came in with Michael's medicine. You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana's mouth, he had said reprovingly, &#x201c;Be a man, Michael.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Won't; won't!&#x201d; Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mother, don't pamper him,&#x201d; he called after her. &#x201c;Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, 'Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, &#x201c;That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ever so much nastier,&#x201d; Mr. Darling said bravely, &#x201c;and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the bottle.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I know where it is, father,&#x201d; Wendy cried, always glad to be of service. &#x201c;I'll bring it,&#x201d; and she was off before he could stop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John,&#x201d; he said, shuddering, &#x201c;it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It will soon be over, father,&#x201d; John said cheerily, and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have been as quick as I could,&#x201d; she panted.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have been wonderfully quick,&#x201d; her father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. &#x201c;Michael first,&#x201d; he said doggedly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Father first,&#x201d; said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall be sick, you know,&#x201d; Mr. Darling said threateningly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Come on, father,&#x201d; said John.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hold your tongue, John,&#x201d; his father rapped out.&#013;&#013;Wendy was quite puzzled. &#x201c;I thought you took it quite easily, father.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is not the point,&#x201d; he retorted. &#x201c;The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michael's spoon.&#x201d; His proud heart was nearly bursting. &#x201c;And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were with my last breath; it isn't fair.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Father, I am waiting,&#x201d; said Michael coldly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Father's a cowardly custard.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So are you a cowardly custard.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'm not frightened.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Neither am I frightened.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then, take it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then, you take it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wendy had a splendid idea. &#x201c;Why not both take it at the same time?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; said Mr. Darling. &#x201c;Are you ready, Michael?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.&#013;&#013;There was a yell of rage from Michael, and &#x201c;O father!&#x201d; Wendy exclaimed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you mean by 'O father'?&#x201d; Mr. Darling demanded. &#x201c;Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I&#x2014;I missed it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did not admire him. &#x201c;Look here, all of you,&#x201d; he said entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. &#x201c;I have just thought of a splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana's bowl, and she will drink it, thinking it is milk!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father's sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana's bowl. &#x201c;What fun!&#x201d; he said doubtfully, and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nana, good dog,&#x201d; he said, patting her, &#x201c;I have put a little milk into your bowl, Nana.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.&#013;&#013;Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. &#x201c;O George,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it's your medicine!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was only a joke,&#x201d; he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy hugged Nana. &#x201c;Much good,&#x201d; he said bitterly, &#x201c;my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And still Wendy hugged Nana. &#x201c;That's right,&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I be coddled&#x2014;why, why, why!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;George,&#x201d; Mrs. Darling entreated him, &#x201c;not so loud; the servants will hear you.&#x201d; Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let them!&#x201d; he answered recklessly. &#x201c;Bring in the whole world. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He felt he was a strong man again. &#x201c;In vain, in vain,&#x201d; he cried; &#x201c;the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up this instant.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;George, George,&#x201d; Mrs. Darling whispered, &#x201c;remember what I told you about that boy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.&#013;&#013;In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered, &#x201c;It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,&#x201d; but Wendy was wiser.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is not Nana's unhappy bark,&#x201d; she said, little guessing what was about to happen; &#x201c;that is her bark when she smells danger.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Danger!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you sure, Wendy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, &#x201c;Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party to-night!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked, &#x201c;Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nothing, precious,&#x201d; she said; &#x201c;they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael flung his arms round her. &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;I'm glad of you.&#x201d; They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.&#013;&#013;No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now, Peter!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 3 COME AWAY, COME AWAY!&#013;For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.&#013;&#013;There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT. [plump hourglass figure]&#013;&#013;A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tinker Bell,&#x201d; he called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, &#x201c;Tink, where are you?&#x201d; She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.&#013;&#013;Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha'pence to the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.&#013;&#013;If he thought at all, but I don't believe he ever thought, it was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.&#013;&#013;His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boy,&#x201d; she said courteously, &#x201c;why are you crying?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What's your name?&#x201d; he asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy Moira Angela Darling,&#x201d; she replied with some satisfaction. &#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter Pan.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively short name.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'm so sorry,&#x201d; said Wendy Moira Angela.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It doesn't matter,&#x201d; Peter gulped.&#013;&#013;She asked where he lived.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Second to the right,&#x201d; said Peter, &#x201c;and then straight on till morning.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What a funny address!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, it isn't,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I mean,&#x201d; Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, &#x201c;is that what they put on the letters?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He wished she had not mentioned letters.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't get any letters,&#x201d; he said contemptuously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But your mother gets letters?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't have a mother,&#x201d; he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Peter, no wonder you were crying,&#x201d; she said, and got out of bed and ran to him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wasn't crying about mothers,&#x201d; he said rather indignantly. &#x201c;I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't crying.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It has come off?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter. &#x201c;How awful!&#x201d; she said, but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!&#013;&#013;Fortunately she knew at once what to do. &#x201c;It must be sewn on,&#x201d; she said, just a little patronisingly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What's sewn?&#x201d; he asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You're dreadfully ignorant.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I'm not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But she was exulting in his ignorance. &#x201c;I shall sew it on for you, my little man,&#x201d; she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I daresay it will hurt a little,&#x201d; she warned him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, I shan't cry,&#x201d; said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps I should have ironed it,&#x201d; Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. &#x201c;How clever I am!&#x201d; he crowed rapturously, &#x201c;oh, the cleverness of me!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy.&#013;&#013;But for the moment Wendy was shocked. &#x201c;You conceit [braggart],&#x201d; she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; &#x201c;of course I did nothing!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You did a little,&#x201d; Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A little!&#x201d; she replied with hauteur [pride]; &#x201c;if I am no use I can at least withdraw,&#x201d; and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets.&#013;&#013;To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot. &#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself.&#x201d; Still she would not look up, though she was listening eagerly. &#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, &#x201c;Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you really think so, Peter?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think it's perfectly sweet of you,&#x201d; she declared, &#x201c;and I'll get up again,&#x201d; and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Surely you know what a kiss is?&#x201d; she asked, aghast.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall know when you give it to me,&#x201d; he replied stiffly, and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;shall I give you a kiss?&#x201d; and she replied with a slight primness, &#x201c;If you please.&#x201d; She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to save her life.&#013;&#013;When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of England.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't know,&#x201d; he replied uneasily, &#x201c;but I am quite young.&#x201d; He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a venture, &#x201c;Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearer her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was because I heard father and mother,&#x201d; he explained in a low voice, &#x201c;talking about what I was to be when I became a man.&#x201d; He was extraordinarily agitated now. &#x201c;I don't want ever to be a man,&#x201d; he said with passion. &#x201c;I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies. Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding [spanking]. Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And so,&#x201d; he went on good-naturedly, &#x201c;there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ought to be? Isn't there?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. &#x201c;I can't think where she has gone to,&#x201d; he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; she cried, clutching him, &#x201c;you don't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She was here just now,&#x201d; he said a little impatiently. &#x201c;You don't hear her, do you?&#x201d; and they both listened.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The only sound I hear,&#x201d; said Wendy, &#x201c;is like a tinkle of bells.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language. I think I hear her too.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face. No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; he whispered gleefully, &#x201c;I do believe I shut her up in the drawer!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury. &#x201c;You shouldn't say such things,&#x201d; Peter retorted. &#x201c;Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wendy was not listening to him. &#x201c;O Peter,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;if she would only stand still and let me see her!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They hardly ever stand still,&#x201d; he said, but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. &#x201c;O the lovely!&#x201d; she cried, though Tink's face was still distorted with passion.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tink,&#x201d; said Peter amiably, &#x201c;this lady says she wishes you were her fairy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Tinker Bell answered insolently.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What does she say, Peter?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He had to translate. &#x201c;She is not very polite. She says you are a great [huge] ugly girl, and that she is my fairy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He tried to argue with Tink. &#x201c;You know you can't be my fairy, Tink, because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To this Tink replied in these words, &#x201c;You silly ass,&#x201d; and disappeared into the bathroom. &#x201c;She is quite a common fairy,&#x201d; Peter explained apologetically, &#x201c;she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles [tinker = tin worker].&#x201d; [Similar to &#x201c;cinder&#x201d; plus &#x201c;elle&#x201d; to get Cinderella]&#013;&#013;They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with more questions.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you don't live in Kensington Gardens now&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sometimes I do still.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But where do you live mostly now?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With the lost boys.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm captain.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What fun it must be!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said cunning Peter, &#x201c;but we are rather lonely. You see we have no female companionship.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are none of the others girls?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their prams.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This flattered Wendy immensely. &#x201c;I think,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there. &#x201c;And I know you meant to be kind,&#x201d; she said, relenting, &#x201c;so you may give me a kiss.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. &#x201c;I thought you would want it back,&#x201d; he said a little bitterly, and offered to return her the thimble.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said the nice Wendy, &#x201c;I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What's that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's like this.&#x201d; She kissed him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Funny!&#x201d; said Peter gravely. &#x201c;Now shall I give you a thimble?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you wish to,&#x201d; said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.&#013;&#013;Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. &#x201c;What is it, Wendy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a thimble.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But why?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, Tink?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Again Tink replied, &#x201c;You silly ass.&#x201d; Peter could not understand why, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any stories.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How perfectly awful,&#x201d; Wendy said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you know,&#x201d; Peter asked &#x201c;why swallows build in the eaves of houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you such a lovely story.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Which story was it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass slipper.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; said Wendy excitedly, &#x201c;that was Cinderella, and he found her, and they lived happily ever after.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, and hurried to the window.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d; she cried with misgiving.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To tell the other boys.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't go Peter,&#x201d; she entreated, &#x201c;I know such lots of stories.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him.&#013;&#013;He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her, but did not.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!&#x201d; she cried, and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let me go!&#x201d; she ordered him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, &#x201c;Oh dear, I can't. Think of mummy! Besides, I can't fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'll teach you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, how lovely to fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back, and then away we go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo!&#x201d; she exclaimed rapturously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And, Wendy, there are mermaids.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mermaids! With tails?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Such long tails.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; cried Wendy, &#x201c;to see a mermaid!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He had become frightfully cunning. &#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;how we should all respect you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor.&#013;&#013;But he had no pity for her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; he said, the sly one, &#x201c;you could tuck us in at night.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;None of us has ever been tucked in at night.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo,&#x201d; and her arms went out to him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has any pockets.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;How could she resist. &#x201c;Of course it's awfully fascinating!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you like,&#x201d; he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael and shook them. &#x201c;Wake up,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;John rubbed his eyes. &#x201c;Then I shall get up,&#x201d; he said. Of course he was on the floor already. &#x201c;Hallo,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I am up!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they had heard.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Out with the light! Hide! Quick!&#x201d; cried John, taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.&#013;&#013;Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There, you suspicious brute,&#x201d; she said, not sorry that Nana was in disgrace. &#x201c;They are perfectly safe, aren't they? Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to drag herself out of Liza's clutches.&#013;&#013;But Liza was dense. &#x201c;No more of it, Nana,&#x201d; she said sternly, pulling her out of the room. &#x201c;I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh, won't master whip you, just.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.&#013;&#013;But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.&#013;&#013;We now return to the nursery.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's all right,&#x201d; John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. &#x201c;I say, Peter, can you really fly?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How topping!&#x201d; said John and Michael.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How sweet!&#x201d; cried Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!&#x201d; said Peter, forgetting his manners again.&#013;&#013;It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say, how do you do it?&#x201d; asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a practical boy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,&#x201d; Peter explained, &#x201c;and they lift you up in the air.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He showed them again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You're so nippy at it,&#x201d; John said, &#x201c;couldn't you do it very slowly once?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter did it both slowly and quickly. &#x201c;I've got it now, Wendy!&#x201d; cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.&#013;&#013;Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and let go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I flewed!&#x201d; he screamed while still in mid-air.&#013;&#013;John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, lovely!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, ripping!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Look at me!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Look at me!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Look at me!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.&#013;&#013;Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say,&#x201d; cried John, &#x201c;why shouldn't we all go out?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.&#013;&#013;Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mermaids!&#x201d; said Peter again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And there are pirates.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pirates,&#x201d; cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, &#x201c;let us go at once.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but in the air.&#013;&#013;Not three figures, four!&#013;&#013;In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to make her heart go softly.&#013;&#013;Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end.&#013;&#013;They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Cave, Peter!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; he cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and Michael and Wendy.&#013;&#013;Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were flown.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 4 THE FLIGHT&#013;&#x201c;Second to the right, and straight on till morning.&#x201d;&#013;That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head.&#013;&#013;At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.&#013;&#013;John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.&#013;&#013;They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.&#013;&#013;Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second sea and their third night.&#013;&#013;Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.&#013;&#013;Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There he goes again!&#x201d; he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Save him, save him!&#x201d; cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.&#013;&#013;He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do be more polite to him,&#x201d; Wendy whispered to John, when they were playing &#x201c;Follow my Leader.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then tell him to stop showing off,&#x201d; said John.&#013;&#013;When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You must be nice to him,&#x201d; Wendy impressed on her brothers. &#x201c;What could we do if he were to leave us!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We could go back,&#x201d; Michael said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How could we ever find our way back without him?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then, we could go on,&#x201d; said John.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don't know how to stop.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.&#013;&#013;John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And who is to get food for us, John?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;After the twentieth try,&#x201d; Wendy reminded him. &#x201c;And even though we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.&#013;&#013;Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And if he forgets them so quickly,&#x201d; Wendy argued, &#x201c;how can we expect that he will go on remembering us?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'm Wendy,&#x201d; she said agitatedly.&#013;&#013;He was very sorry. &#x201c;I say, Wendy,&#x201d; he whispered to her, &#x201c;always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice, &#x201c;We get off here.&#x201d; So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There it is,&#x201d; said Peter calmly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where, where?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where all the arrows are pointing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.&#013;&#013;Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John, there's the lagoon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Look, Michael, there's your cave!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John, what's that in the brushwood?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that's your little whelp!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There's my boat, John, with her sides stove in!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, it isn't. Why, we burned your boat.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That's her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin camp!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where? Show me, and I'll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they are on the war-path.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There, just across the Mysterious River.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them?&#013;&#013;It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.&#013;&#013;In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.&#013;&#013;Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment, and where was Nana?&#013;&#013;They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They don't want us to land,&#x201d; he explained.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; Wendy whispered, shuddering.&#013;&#013;But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.&#013;&#013;Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.&#013;&#013;His courage was almost appalling. &#x201c;Would you like an adventure now,&#x201d; he said casually to John, &#x201c;or would you like to have your tea first?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wendy said &#x201c;tea first&#x201d; quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What kind of adventure?&#x201d; he asked cautiously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,&#x201d; Peter told him. &#x201c;If you like, we'll go down and kill him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't see him,&#x201d; John said after a long pause.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Suppose,&#x201d; John said, a little huskily, &#x201c;he were to wake up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter spoke indignantly. &#x201c;You don't think I would kill him while he was sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That's the way I always do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say! Do you kill many?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tons.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;John said &#x201c;How ripping,&#x201d; but decided to have tea first. He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had never known so many.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who is captain now?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hook,&#x201d; answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that hated word.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Jas. Hook?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, for they knew Hook's reputation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He was Blackbeard's bo'sun,&#x201d; John whispered huskily. &#x201c;He is the worst of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That's him,&#x201d; said Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is he like? Is he big?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is not so big as he was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How do you mean?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I cut off a bit of him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, me,&#x201d; said Peter sharply.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wasn't meaning to be disrespectful.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, all right.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, I say, what bit?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;His right hand.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then he can't fight now?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, can't he just!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Left-hander?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Claws!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say, John,&#x201d; said Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Say, 'Ay, ay, sir.'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay, sir.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is one thing,&#x201d; Peter continued, &#x201c;that every boy who serves under me has to promise, and so must you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;John paled.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I promise,&#x201d; John said loyally.&#013;&#013;For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She tells me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came, and got Long Tom out.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The big gun?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Michael!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tell her to go away at once, Peter,&#x201d; the three cried simultaneously, but he refused.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She thinks we have lost the way,&#x201d; he replied stiffly, &#x201c;and she is rather frightened. You don't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a loving little pinch.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then tell her,&#x201d; Wendy begged, &#x201c;to put out her light.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She can't put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can't do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then tell her to sleep at once,&#x201d; John almost ordered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other thing fairies can't do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Seems to me,&#x201d; growled John, &#x201c;these are the only two things worth doing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If only one of us had a pocket,&#x201d; Peter said, &#x201c;we could carry her in it.&#x201d; However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them.&#013;&#013;He had a happy idea. John's hat!&#013;&#013;Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.&#013;&#013;In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.&#013;&#013;Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. &#x201c;If only something would make a sound!&#x201d; he cried.&#013;&#013;As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.&#013;&#013;The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely, &#x201c;Where are they, where are they, where are they?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true.&#013;&#013;When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you shot?&#x201d; John whispered tremulously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I haven't tried [myself out] yet,&#x201d; Michael whispered back.&#013;&#013;We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell.&#013;&#013;It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat.&#013;&#013;I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction.&#013;&#013;Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning &#x201c;Follow me, and all will be well.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her doom.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 5 THE ISLAND COME TRUE&#013;Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by Peter.&#013;&#013;In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething with life.&#013;&#013;On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate.&#013;&#013;All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.&#013;&#013;They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed.&#013;&#013;The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing her mischief], and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys. 'Ware Tinker Bell.&#013;&#013;Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passes by, biting his knuckles.&#013;&#013;Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, [a person who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly, &#x201c;Stand forth the one who did this thing,&#x201d; that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.&#013;&#013;The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,&#013;     A-pirating we go,&#013;     And if we're parted by a shot&#013;     We're sure to meet below!&#x201d;&#013; &#013;A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces]; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy's brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights (Morgan's Skylights); and the Irish bo'sun Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist in Hook's crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main.&#013;&#013;In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous [dead looking] and blackavized [dark faced], and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw.&#013;&#013;Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook's method. Skylights will do. As they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth.&#013;&#013;Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win?&#013;&#013;On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful of dusky Dianas [Diana = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the Piccaninnies, coquettish [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.&#013;&#013;The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.&#013;&#013;When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.&#013;&#013;The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.&#013;&#013;All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was.&#013;&#013;The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselves down on the sward [turf], close to their underground home.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do wish Peter would come back,&#x201d; every one of them said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,&#x201d; Slightly said, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, &#x201c;but I wish he would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her.&#013;&#013;It was only in Peter's absence that they could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by him as silly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All I remember about my mother,&#x201d; Nibs told them, &#x201c;is that she often said to my father, 'Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!' I don't know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my mother one.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim song:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,&#013;     The flag o' skull and bones,&#013;     A merry hour, a hempen rope,&#013;     And hey for Davy Jones.&#x201d;&#013; &#013;At once the lost boys&#x2014;but where are they? They are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.&#013;&#013;I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons. Will he find it tonight?&#013;&#013;As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped his shoulder.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Captain, let go!&#x201d; he cried, writhing.&#013;&#013;Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice. &#x201c;Put back that pistol first,&#x201d; it said threateningly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins upon us. Do you want to lose your scalp?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shall I after him, Captain,&#x201d; asked pathetic Smee, &#x201c;and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?&#x201d; Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Johnny's a silent fellow,&#x201d; he reminded Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not now, Smee,&#x201d; Hook said darkly. &#x201c;He is only one, and I want to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo'sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.&#013;&#013;Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Most of all,&#x201d; Hook was saying passionately, &#x201c;I want their captain, Peter Pan. 'Twas he cut off my arm.&#x201d; He brandished the hook threateningly. &#x201c;I've waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I'll tear him!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And yet,&#x201d; said Smee, &#x201c;I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; the captain answered, &#x201c;if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that,&#x201d; and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he frowned.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter flung my arm,&#x201d; he said, wincing, &#x201c;to a crocodile that happened to be passing by.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have often,&#x201d; said Smee, &#x201c;noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not of crocodiles,&#x201d; Hook corrected him, &#x201c;but of that one crocodile.&#x201d; He lowered his voice. &#x201c;It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips for the rest of me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In a way,&#x201d; said Smee, &#x201c;it's sort of a compliment.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I want no such compliments,&#x201d; Hook barked petulantly. &#x201c;I want Peter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice. &#x201c;Smee,&#x201d; he said huskily, &#x201c;that crocodile would have had me before this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.&#x201d; He laughed, but in a hollow way.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Some day,&#x201d; said Smee, &#x201c;the clock will run down, and then he'll get you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Hook wetted his dry lips. &#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that's the fear that haunts me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. &#x201c;Smee,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this seat is hot.&#x201d; He jumped up. &#x201c;Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. &#x201c;A chimney!&#x201d; they both exclaimed.&#013;&#013;They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood.&#013;&#013;Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you hear them say Peter Pan's from home?&#x201d; Smee whispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.&#013;&#013;Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. &#x201c;Unrip your plan, captain,&#x201d; he cried eagerly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To return to the ship,&#x201d; Hook replied slowly through his teeth, &#x201c;and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp cake.&#x201d; He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. &#x201c;Aha, they will die.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Smee had listened with growing admiration.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!&#x201d; he cried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;Avast, belay, when I appear,&#013;     By fear they're overtook;&#013;     Nought's left upon your bones when you&#013;     Have shaken claws with Hook.&#x201d;&#013; &#013;They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.&#013;&#013;Tick tick tick tick!&#013;&#013;Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The crocodile!&#x201d; he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo'sun.&#013;&#013;It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.&#013;&#013;Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Save me, save me!&#x201d; cried Nibs, falling on the ground.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But what can we do, what can we do?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What would Peter do?&#x201d; they cried simultaneously.&#013;&#013;Almost in the same breath they cried, &#x201c;Peter would look at them through his legs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And then, &#x201c;Let us do what Peter would do.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.&#013;&#013;Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I have seen a wonderfuller thing,&#x201d; he cried, as they gathered round him eagerly. &#x201c;A great white bird. It is flying this way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What kind of a bird, do you think?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't know,&#x201d; Nibs said, awestruck, &#x201c;but it looks so weary, and as it flies it moans, 'Poor Wendy.'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Poor Wendy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; said Slightly instantly, &#x201c;there are birds called Wendies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;See, it comes!&#x201d; cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.&#013;&#013;Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry. But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she touched.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo, Tink,&#x201d; cried the wondering boys.&#013;&#013;Tink's reply rang out: &#x201c;Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. &#x201c;Let us do what Peter wishes!&#x201d; cried the simple boys. &#x201c;Quick, bows and arrows!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with him, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Quick, Tootles, quick,&#x201d; she screamed. &#x201c;Peter will be so pleased.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. &#x201c;Out of the way, Tink,&#x201d; he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 6 THE LITTLE HOUSE&#013;Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy's body when the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are too late,&#x201d; he cried proudly, &#x201c;I have shot the Wendy. Peter will be so pleased with me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Overhead Tinker Bell shouted &#x201c;Silly ass!&#x201d; and darted into hiding. The others did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy's heart had been beating they would all have heard it.&#013;&#013;Slightly was the first to speak. &#x201c;This is no bird,&#x201d; he said in a scared voice. &#x201c;I think this must be a lady.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A lady?&#x201d; said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And we have killed her,&#x201d; Nibs said hoarsely.&#013;&#013;They all whipped off their caps.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now I see,&#x201d; Curly said: &#x201c;Peter was bringing her to us.&#x201d; He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A lady to take care of us at last,&#x201d; said one of the twins, &#x201c;and you have killed her!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him.&#013;&#013;Tootles' face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I did it,&#x201d; he said, reflecting. &#x201c;When ladies used to come to me in dreams, I said, 'Pretty mother, pretty mother.' But when at last she really came, I shot her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He moved slowly away.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't go,&#x201d; they called in pity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must,&#x201d; he answered, shaking; &#x201c;I am so afraid of Peter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter!&#x201d; they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his return.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hide her,&#x201d; they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But Tootles stood aloof.&#013;&#013;Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them. &#x201c;Greetings, boys,&#x201d; he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then again was silence.&#013;&#013;He frowned.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am back,&#x201d; he said hotly, &#x201c;why do you not cheer?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Great news, boys,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;I have brought at last a mother for you all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have you not seen her?&#x201d; asked Peter, becoming troubled. &#x201c;She flew this way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah me!&#x201d; one voice said, and another said, &#x201c;Oh, mournful day.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Tootles rose. &#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;I will show her to you,&#x201d; and when the others would still have hidden her he said, &#x201c;Back, twins, let Peter see.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is dead,&#x201d; he said uncomfortably. &#x201c;Perhaps she is frightened at being dead.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this.&#013;&#013;But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Whose arrow?&#x201d; he demanded sternly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mine, Peter,&#x201d; said Tootles on his knees.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, dastard hand,&#x201d; Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger.&#013;&#013;Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. &#x201c;Strike, Peter,&#x201d; he said firmly, &#x201c;strike true.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. &#x201c;I cannot strike,&#x201d; he said with awe, &#x201c;there is something stays my hand.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is she,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;the Wendy lady, see, her arm!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Wonderful to relate [tell], Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and listened reverently. &#x201c;I think she said, 'Poor Tootles,'&#x201d; he whispered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She lives,&#x201d; Peter said briefly.&#013;&#013;Slightly cried instantly, &#x201c;The Wendy lady lives.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;See,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave her. It has saved her life.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I remember kisses,&#x201d; Slightly interposed quickly, &#x201c;let me see it. Ay, that's a kiss.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so that he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet, being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Listen to Tink,&#x201d; said Curly, &#x201c;she is crying because the Wendy lives.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then they had to tell Peter of Tink's crime, and almost never had they seen him look so stern.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Listen, Tinker Bell,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;I am your friend no more. Begone from me for ever.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, &#x201c;Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed [slapped] them.&#013;&#013;But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let us carry her down into the house,&#x201d; Curly suggested.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; said Slightly, &#x201c;that is what one does with ladies.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; Peter said, &#x201c;you must not touch her. It would not be sufficiently respectful.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That,&#x201d; said Slightly, &#x201c;is what I was thinking.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if she lies there,&#x201d; Tootles said, &#x201c;she will die.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, she will die,&#x201d; Slightly admitted, &#x201c;but there is no way out.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, there is,&#x201d; cried Peter. &#x201c;Let us build a little house round her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were all delighted. &#x201c;Quick,&#x201d; he ordered them, &#x201c;bring me each of you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding. They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and slept again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John, John,&#x201d; Michael would cry, &#x201c;wake up! Where is Nana, John, and mother?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, &#x201c;It is true, we did fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo, Peter,&#x201d; they said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo,&#x201d; replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is Wendy asleep?&#x201d; they asked.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John,&#x201d; Michael proposed, &#x201c;let us wake her and get her to make supper for us,&#x201d; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house. &#x201c;Look at them!&#x201d; he cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Curly,&#x201d; said Peter in his most captainy voice, &#x201c;see that these boys help in the building of the house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay, sir.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Build a house?&#x201d; exclaimed John.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;For the Wendy,&#x201d; said Curly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;For Wendy?&#x201d; John said, aghast. &#x201c;Why, she is only a girl!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That,&#x201d; explained Curly, &#x201c;is why we are her servants.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You? Wendy's servants!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Peter, &#x201c;and you also. Away with them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry. &#x201c;Chairs and a fender [fireplace] first,&#x201d; Peter ordered. &#x201c;Then we shall build a house round them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; said Slightly, &#x201c;that is how a house is built; it all comes back to me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter thought of everything. &#x201c;Slightly,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;fetch a doctor.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay,&#x201d; said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head. But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing John's hat and looking solemn.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Please, sir,&#x201d; said Peter, going to him, &#x201c;are you a doctor?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners.&#013;&#013;If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, my little man,&#x201d; Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Please, sir,&#x201d; Peter explained, &#x201c;a lady lies very ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tut, tut, tut,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;where does she lie?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In yonder glade.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will put a glass thing in her mouth,&#x201d; said Slightly, and he made-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How is she?&#x201d; inquired Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tut, tut, tut,&#x201d; said Slightly, &#x201c;this has cured her.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am glad!&#x201d; Peter cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will call again in the evening,&#x201d; Slightly said; &#x201c;give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it;&#x201d; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty.&#013;&#013;In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy's feet.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If only we knew,&#x201d; said one, &#x201c;the kind of house she likes best.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; shouted another, &#x201c;she is moving in her sleep.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Her mouth opens,&#x201d; cried a third, looking respectfully into it. &#x201c;Oh, lovely!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,&#x201d; said Peter. &#x201c;Wendy, sing the kind of house you would like to have.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;I wish I had a pretty house,&#013;     The littlest ever seen,&#013;     With funny little red walls&#013;     And roof of mossy green.&#x201d;&#013; &#013;They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;We've built the little walls and roof&#013;     And made a lovely door,&#013;     So tell us, mother Wendy,&#013;     What are you wanting more?&#x201d;&#013; &#013;To this she answered greedily:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;Oh, really next I think I'll have&#013;     Gay windows all about,&#013;     With roses peeping in, you know,&#013;     And babies peeping out.&#x201d;&#013; &#013;With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were the blinds. But roses&#x2014;?&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Roses,&#x201d; cried Peter sternly.&#013;&#013;Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.&#013;&#013;Babies?&#013;&#013;To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;We've made the roses peeping out,&#013;     The babes are at the door,&#013;     We cannot make ourselves, you know,&#013;     'cos we've been made before.&#x201d;&#013; &#013;Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There's no knocker on the door,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it made an excellent knocker.&#013;&#013;Absolutely finished now, they thought.&#013;&#013;Not of bit of it. &#x201c;There's no chimney,&#x201d; Peter said; &#x201c;we must have a chimney.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It certainly does need a chimney,&#x201d; said John importantly. This gave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John's head, knocked out the bottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.&#013;&#013;Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All look your best,&#x201d; Peter warned them; &#x201c;first impressions are awfully important.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all too busy looking their best.&#013;&#013;He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.&#013;&#013;What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a lady, what would she be like?&#013;&#013;The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off their hats.&#013;&#013;She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she would look.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; she said.&#013;&#013;Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. &#x201c;Wendy lady,&#x201d; he said rapidly, &#x201c;for you we built this house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, say you're pleased,&#x201d; cried Nibs.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lovely, darling house,&#x201d; Wendy said, and they were the very words they had hoped she would say.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And we are your children,&#x201d; cried the twins.&#013;&#013;Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, &#x201c;O Wendy lady, be our mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ought I?&#x201d; Wendy said, all shining. &#x201c;Of course it's frightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real experience.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That doesn't matter,&#x201d; said Peter, as if he were the only person present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew least. &#x201c;What we need is just a nice motherly person.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear!&#x201d; Wendy said, &#x201c;you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is, it is,&#x201d; they all cried; &#x201c;we saw it at once.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I will do my best. Come inside at once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time he fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed on.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND&#013;One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in [let out] your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful.&#013;&#013;But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition.&#013;&#013;Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be altered a little.&#013;&#013;After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig [for worms] if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have [desired] a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.&#013;&#013;It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.&#013;&#013;I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.&#013;&#013;Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.&#013;&#013;When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, &#x201c;Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.&#013;&#013;You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each other's arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.&#013;&#013;As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother. These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school. The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary questions&#x2014;&#x201c;What was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible.&#x201d; &#x201c;(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared. Only one of these to be attempted.&#x201d; Or &#x201c;(1) Describe Mother's laugh; (2) Describe Father's laugh; (3) Describe Mother's Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.&#013;&#013;Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that sort of thing.&#013;&#013;By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too.&#013;&#013;Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would have treated them severely.&#013;&#013;He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out, &#x201c;I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?&#x201d; And Tootles answered, &#x201c;Redskin; what are you, Nibs?&#x201d; and Nibs said, &#x201c;Redskin; what are you Twin?&#x201d; and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.&#013;&#013;The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was&#x2014;but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally.&#013;&#013;Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.&#013;&#013;Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.&#013;&#013;Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss for it.&#013;&#013;I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won. Of course I could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON&#013;If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.&#013;&#013;The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.&#013;&#013;They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.&#013;&#013;The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.&#013;&#013;But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.&#013;&#013;It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.&#013;&#013;It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.&#013;&#013;While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly.&#013;&#013;It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?&#013;&#013;There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners' Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.&#013;&#013;Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?&#013;&#013;It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.&#013;&#013;He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pirates!&#x201d; he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dive!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted. Marooners' Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned.&#013;&#013;The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief's daughter, it is enough.&#013;&#013;They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook's boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.&#013;&#013;In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock till they crashed into it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Luff, you lubber,&#x201d; cried an Irish voice that was Smee's; &#x201c;here's the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leave her here to drown.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.&#013;&#013;Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, Peter's and Wendy's. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.&#013;&#013;There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice of Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ahoy there, you lubbers!&#x201d; he called. It was a marvellous imitation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The captain!&#x201d; said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He must be swimming out to us,&#x201d; Starkey said, when they had looked for him in vain.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are putting the redskin on the rock,&#x201d; Smee called out.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Set her free,&#x201d; came the astonishing answer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Free!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, captain&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;At once, d'ye hear,&#x201d; cried Peter, &#x201c;or I'll plunge my hook in you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;This is queer!&#x201d; Smee gasped.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Better do what the captain orders,&#x201d; said Starkey nervously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay,&#x201d; Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily's cords. At once like an eel she slid between Starkey's legs into the water.&#013;&#013;Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter's cleverness; but she knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was stayed even in the act, for &#x201c;Boat ahoy!&#x201d; rang over the lagoon in Hook's voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.&#013;&#013;Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boat ahoy!&#x201d; again came the voice.&#013;&#013;Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.&#013;&#013;He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip the boat's side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. &#x201c;Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!&#x201d; he whispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.&#013;&#013;He signed to her to listen.&#013;&#013;The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound melancholy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Captain, is all well?&#x201d; they asked timidly, but he answered with a hollow moan.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He sighs,&#x201d; said Smee.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He sighs again,&#x201d; said Starkey.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And yet a third time he sighs,&#x201d; said Smee.&#013;&#013;Then at last he spoke passionately.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The game's up,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;those boys have found a mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O evil day!&#x201d; cried Starkey.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What's a mother?&#x201d; asked the ignorant Smee.&#013;&#013;Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. &#x201c;He doesn't know!&#x201d; and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be her one.&#013;&#013;Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying, &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I heard nothing,&#x201d; said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;See,&#x201d; said Hook in answer to Smee's question, &#x201c;that is a mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother desert her eggs? No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent days when&#x2014;but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.&#013;&#013;Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the more suspicious Starkey said, &#x201c;If she is a mother, perhaps she is hanging about here to help Peter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Hook winced. &#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that is the fear that haunts me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He was roused from this dejection by Smee's eager voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; said Smee, &#x201c;could we not kidnap these boys' mother and make her our mother?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is a princely scheme,&#x201d; cried Hook, and at once it took practical shape in his great brain. &#x201c;We will seize the children and carry them to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Again Wendy forgot herself.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Never!&#x201d; she cried, and bobbed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind. &#x201c;Do you agree, my bullies?&#x201d; asked Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There is my hand on it,&#x201d; they both said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And there is my hook. Swear.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook remembered Tiger Lily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Where is the redskin?&#x201d; he demanded abruptly.&#013;&#013;He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the moments.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is all right, captain,&#x201d; Smee answered complacently; &#x201c;we let her go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let her go!&#x201d; cried Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;'Twas your own orders,&#x201d; the bo'sun faltered.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You called over the water to us to let her go,&#x201d; said Starkey.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Brimstone and gall,&#x201d; thundered Hook, &#x201c;what cozening [cheating] is going on here!&#x201d; His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they believed their words, and he was startled. &#x201c;Lads,&#x201d; he said, shaking a little, &#x201c;I gave no such order.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is passing queer,&#x201d; Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably. Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;dost hear me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He immediately answered in Hook's voice:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee and Starkey clung to each other in terror.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are you, stranger? Speak!&#x201d; Hook demanded.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am James Hook,&#x201d; replied the voice, &#x201c;captain of the JOLLY ROGER.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are not; you are not,&#x201d; Hook cried hoarsely.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Brimstone and gall,&#x201d; the voice retorted, &#x201c;say that again, and I'll cast anchor in you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. &#x201c;If you are Hook,&#x201d; he said almost humbly, &#x201c;come tell me, who am I?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A codfish,&#x201d; replied the voice, &#x201c;only a codfish.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;A codfish!&#x201d; Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then, that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!&#x201d; they muttered. &#x201c;It is lowering to our pride.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had become, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego slipping from him. &#x201c;Don't desert me, bully,&#x201d; he whispered hoarsely to it.&#013;&#013;In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried the guessing game.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hook,&#x201d; he called, &#x201c;have you another voice?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own voice, &#x201c;I have.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And another name?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Vegetable?&#x201d; asked Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mineral?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Animal?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Man?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; This answer rang out scornfully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ordinary boy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wonderful boy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To Wendy's pain the answer that rang out this time was &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you in England?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Hook was completely puzzled. &#x201c;You ask him some questions,&#x201d; he said to the others, wiping his damp brow.&#013;&#013;Smee reflected. &#x201c;I can't think of a thing,&#x201d; he said regretfully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can't guess, can't guess!&#x201d; crowed Peter. &#x201c;Do you give it up?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the miscreants [villains] saw their chance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; they answered eagerly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;I am Peter Pan.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Pan!&#013;&#013;In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his faithful henchmen.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now we have him,&#x201d; Hook shouted. &#x201c;Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind the boat. Take him dead or alive!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you ready, boys?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay,&#x201d; from various parts of the lagoon.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then lam into the pirates.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. He wriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.&#013;&#013;Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinked [nicked] in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.&#013;&#013;Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.&#013;&#013;The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.&#013;&#013;But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that circle.&#013;&#013;Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they met.&#013;&#013;Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to [began combat] they had a sinking [feeling in the stomach]. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook's belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe. It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.&#013;&#013;It was then that Hook bit him.&#013;&#013;Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made him quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After you have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest.&#013;&#013;So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.&#013;&#013;A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting &#x201c;Peter, Wendy&#x201d; as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids. &#x201c;They must be swimming back or flying,&#x201d; the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault!&#013;&#013;When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Help, help!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and lay on the boy's arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more.&#013;&#013;As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to tell her the truth.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are on the rock, Wendy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but it is growing smaller. Soon the water will be over it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She did not understand even now.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We must go,&#x201d; she said, almost brightly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he answered faintly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shall we swim or fly, Peter?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He had to tell her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without my help?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She had to admit that she was too tired.&#013;&#013;He moaned.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; she asked, anxious about him at once.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can't help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you mean we shall both be drowned?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Look how the water is rising.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, &#x201c;Can I be of any use?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Michael's kite,&#x201d; Peter said without interest, but next moment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It lifted Michael off the ground,&#x201d; he cried; &#x201c;why should it not carry you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Both of us!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It can't lift two; Michael and Curly tried.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let us draw lots,&#x201d; Wendy said bravely.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And you a lady; never.&#x201d; Already he had tied the tail round her. She clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a &#x201c;Good-bye, Wendy,&#x201d; he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne out of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.&#013;&#013;The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon.&#013;&#013;Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, &#x201c;To die will be an awfully big adventure.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD&#013;The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.&#013;&#013;Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.&#013;&#013;Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.&#013;&#013;It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.&#013;&#013;She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other's language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2014;want&#x2014;you&#x2014;to&#x2014;get&#x2014;into&#x2014;the&#x2014;nest,&#x201d; the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible, &#x201c;and&#x2014;then&#x2014;you&#x2014;can&#x2014;drift&#x2014;ashore, but&#x2014;I&#x2014;am&#x2014;too&#x2014;tired&#x2014;to&#x2014;bring&#x2014;it&#x2014;any&#x2014;nearer&#x2014;so&#x2014;you&#x2014;must&#x2014;try to&#x2014;swim&#x2014;to&#x2014;it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What are you quacking about?&#x201d; Peter answered. &#x201c;Why don't you let the nest drift as usual?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I&#x2014;want&#x2014;you&#x2014;&#x201d; the bird said, and repeated it all over.&#013;&#013;Then Peter tried slow and distinct.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What&#x2014;are&#x2014;you&#x2014;quacking&#x2014;about?&#x201d; and so on.&#013;&#013;The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You dunderheaded little jay!&#x201d; she screamed, &#x201c;Why don't you do as I tell you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So are you!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.&#013;&#013;Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.&#013;&#013;There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.&#013;&#013;I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.&#013;&#013;The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both cheering.&#013;&#013;Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque [small ship, actually the Never Bird's nest in this particular case in point] in a place where the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing.&#013;&#013;Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, &#x201c;To bed, to bed,&#x201d; in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 10 THE HAPPY HOME&#013;One important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.&#013;&#013;They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves [lying down] before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The great white father,&#x201d; he would say to them in a very lordly manner, as they grovelled at his feet, &#x201c;is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Me Tiger Lily,&#x201d; that lovely creature would reply. &#x201c;Peter Pan save me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, &#x201c;It is good. Peter Pan has spoken.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Always when he said, &#x201c;Peter Pan has spoken,&#x201d; it meant that they must now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just ordinary braves. They said &#x201c;How-do?&#x201d; to them, and things like that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.&#013;&#013;Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. &#x201c;Father knows best,&#x201d; she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.&#013;&#013;We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.&#013;&#013;The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying, &#x201c;I complain of so-and-so;&#x201d; but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Silence,&#x201d; cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them that they were not all to speak at once. &#x201c;Is your mug empty, Slightly darling?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not quite empty, mummy,&#x201d; Slightly said, after looking into an imaginary mug.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He hasn't even begun to drink his milk,&#x201d; Nibs interposed.&#013;&#013;This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I complain of Nibs,&#x201d; he cried promptly.&#013;&#013;John, however, had held up his hand first.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, John?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May I sit in Peter's chair, as he is not here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sit in father's chair, John!&#x201d; Wendy was scandalised. &#x201c;Certainly not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He is not really our father,&#x201d; John answered. &#x201c;He didn't even know how a father does till I showed him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This was grumbling. &#x201c;We complain of John,&#x201d; cried the twins.&#013;&#013;Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't suppose,&#x201d; Tootles said diffidently [bashfully or timidly], &#x201c;that I could be father.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, Tootles.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of going on.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As I can't be father,&#x201d; he said heavily, &#x201c;I don't suppose, Michael, you would let me be baby?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I won't,&#x201d; Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As I can't be baby,&#x201d; Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and heavier, &#x201c;do you think I could be a twin?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, indeed,&#x201d; replied the twins; &#x201c;it's awfully difficult to be a twin.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;As I can't be anything important,&#x201d; said Tootles, &#x201c;would any of you like to see me do a trick?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; they all replied.&#013;&#013;Then at last he stopped. &#x201c;I hadn't really any hope,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;The hateful telling broke out again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Slightly is coughing on the table.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The twins began with cheese-cakes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Curly is taking both butter and honey.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I complain of the twins.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I complain of Curly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I complain of Nibs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear, oh dear,&#x201d; cried Wendy, &#x201c;I'm sure I sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; remonstrated [scolded] Michael, &#x201c;I'm too big for a cradle.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must have somebody in a cradle,&#x201d; she said almost tartly, &#x201c;and you are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.&#013;&#013;There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him at the door.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Watch well, braves. I have spoken.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his tree. As so often before, but never again.&#013;&#013;He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter, you just spoil them, you know,&#x201d; Wendy simpered [exaggerated a smile].&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah, old lady,&#x201d; said Peter, hanging up his gun.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was me told him mothers are called old lady,&#x201d; Michael whispered to Curly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I complain of Michael,&#x201d; said Curly instantly.&#013;&#013;The first twin came to Peter. &#x201c;Father, we want to dance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dance away, my little man,&#x201d; said Peter, who was in high good humour.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But we want you to dance.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be scandalised.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Me! My old bones would rattle!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And mummy too.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What,&#x201d; cried Wendy, &#x201c;the mother of such an armful, dance!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But on a Saturday night,&#x201d; Slightly insinuated.&#013;&#013;It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,&#x201d; Wendy said, relenting.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;People of our figure, Wendy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But it is only among our own progeny [children].&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;True, true.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah, old lady,&#x201d; Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, &#x201c;there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day's toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is sweet, Peter, isn't it?&#x201d; Wendy said, frightfully gratified. &#x201c;Peter, I think Curly has your nose.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Michael takes after you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear Peter,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;with such a large family, of course, I have now passed my best, but you don't want to [ex]change me, do you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, Wendy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably, blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter, what is it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I was just thinking,&#x201d; he said, a little scared. &#x201c;It is only make-believe, isn't it, that I am their father?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; Wendy said primly [formally and properly].&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You see,&#x201d; he continued apologetically, &#x201c;it would make me seem so old to be their real father.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But not really, Wendy?&#x201d; he asked anxiously.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not if you don't wish it,&#x201d; she replied; and she distinctly heard his sigh of relief. &#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; she asked, trying to speak firmly, &#x201c;what are your exact feelings to [about] me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Those of a devoted son, Wendy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I thought so,&#x201d; she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme end of the room.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are so queer,&#x201d; he said, frankly puzzled, &#x201c;and Tiger Lily is just the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is not my mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, indeed, it is not,&#x201d; Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then what is it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It isn't for a lady to tell.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, very well,&#x201d; Peter said, a little nettled. &#x201c;Perhaps Tinker Bell will tell me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,&#x201d; Wendy retorted scornfully. &#x201c;She is an abandoned little creature.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something impudent.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She says she glories in being abandoned,&#x201d; Peter interpreted.&#013;&#013;He had a sudden idea. &#x201c;Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You silly ass!&#x201d; cried Tinker Bell in a passion.&#013;&#013;She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I almost agree with her,&#x201d; Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.&#013;&#013;None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself, and he said gloomily:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the end.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 11 WENDY'S STORY&#013;&#x201c;Listen, then,&#x201d; said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at her feet and seven boys in the bed. &#x201c;There was once a gentleman&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I had rather he had been a lady,&#x201d; Curly said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I wish he had been a white rat,&#x201d; said Nibs.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; their mother admonished [cautioned] them. &#x201c;There was a lady also, and&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, mummy,&#x201d; cried the first twin, &#x201c;you mean that there is a lady also, don't you? She is not dead, is she?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, no.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am awfully glad she isn't dead,&#x201d; said Tootles. &#x201c;Are you glad, John?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course I am.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you glad, Nibs?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Rather.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you glad, Twins?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We are glad.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; sighed Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Little less noise there,&#x201d; Peter called out, determined that she should have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The gentleman's name,&#x201d; Wendy continued, &#x201c;was Mr. Darling, and her name was Mrs. Darling.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I knew them,&#x201d; John said, to annoy the others.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think I knew them,&#x201d; said Michael rather doubtfully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They were married, you know,&#x201d; explained Wendy, &#x201c;and what do you think they had?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;White rats,&#x201d; cried Nibs, inspired.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's awfully puzzling,&#x201d; said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is descendants?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, you are one, Twin.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Descendants are only children,&#x201d; said John.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear, oh dear,&#x201d; sighed Wendy. &#x201c;Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's an awfully good story,&#x201d; said Nibs.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They flew away,&#x201d; Wendy continued, &#x201c;to the Neverland, where the lost children are.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I just thought they did,&#x201d; Curly broke in excitedly. &#x201c;I don't know how it is, but I just thought they did!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Wendy,&#x201d; cried Tootles, &#x201c;was one of the lost children called Tootles?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, he was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents with all their children flown away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo!&#x201d; they all moaned, though they were not really considering the feelings of the unhappy parents one jot.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Think of the empty beds!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oo!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's awfully sad,&#x201d; the first twin said cheerfully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't see how it can have a happy ending,&#x201d; said the second twin. &#x201c;Do you, Nibs?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'm frightfully anxious.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you knew how great is a mother's love,&#x201d; Wendy told them triumphantly, &#x201c;you would have no fear.&#x201d; She had now come to the part that Peter hated.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do like a mother's love,&#x201d; said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow. &#x201c;Do you like a mother's love, Nibs?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do just,&#x201d; said Nibs, hitting back.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You see,&#x201d; Wendy said complacently, &#x201c;our heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did they ever go back?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let us now,&#x201d; said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort, &#x201c;take a peep into the future;&#x201d; and they all gave themselves the twist that makes peeps into the future easier. &#x201c;Years have rolled by, and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Wendy, who is she?&#x201d; cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn't know.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Can it be&#x2014;yes&#x2014;no&#x2014;it is&#x2014;the fair Wendy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to man's estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;'See, dear brothers,' says Wendy pointing upwards, 'there is the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a mother's love.' So up they flew to their mummy and daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.&#013;&#013;So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer.&#013;&#013;But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he uttered a hollow groan.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is it, Peter?&#x201d; she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. &#x201c;Where is it, Peter?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It isn't that kind of pain,&#x201d; Peter replied darkly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then what kind is it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Long ago,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scared them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are you sure mothers are like that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!&#013;&#013;Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when he should give in. &#x201c;Wendy, let us [let's] go home,&#x201d; cried John and Michael together.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, clutching them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Not to-night?&#x201d; asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and that it is only the mothers who think you can't.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;At once,&#x201d; Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come to her: &#x201c;Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter's feelings, and she said to him rather sharply, &#x201c;Peter, will you make the necessary arrangements?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you wish it,&#x201d; he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass the nuts.&#013;&#013;Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind the parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.&#013;&#013;But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.&#013;&#013;Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced upon her threateningly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It will be worse than before she came,&#x201d; they cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We shan't let her go.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let's keep her prisoner.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, chain her up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tootles,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;I appeal to you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.&#013;&#013;Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am just Tootles,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and nobody minds me. But the first who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him severely.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the Neverland against her will.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wendy,&#x201d; he said, striding up and down, &#x201c;I have asked the redskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Thank you, Peter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then,&#x201d; he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed, &#x201c;Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are you? How dare you? Go away,&#x201d; she cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You are to get up, Tink,&#x201d; Nibs called, &#x201c;and take Wendy on a journey.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She says she won't!&#x201d; Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tink,&#x201d; he rapped out, &#x201c;if you don't get up and dress at once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligee [nightgown].&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This made her leap to the floor. &#x201c;Who said I wasn't getting up?&#x201d; she cried.&#013;&#013;In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.&#013;&#013;Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dear ones,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;if you will all come with me I feel almost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But won't they think us rather a handful?&#x201d; Nibs asked in the middle of his jump.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, &#x201c;it will only mean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on first Thursdays.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter, can we go?&#x201d; they all cried imploringly. They took it for granted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest ones.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they rushed to get their things.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And now, Peter,&#x201d; Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, &#x201c;I am going to give you your medicine before you go.&#x201d; She loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Get your things, Peter,&#x201d; she cried, shaking.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he answered, pretending indifference, &#x201c;I am not going with you, Wendy.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, Peter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and down the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run about after him, though it was rather undignified.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To find your mother,&#x201d; she coaxed.&#013;&#013;Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He could do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered only their bad points.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; he told Wendy decisively; &#x201c;perhaps she would say I was old, and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, Peter&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And so the others had to be told.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter isn't coming.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their backs, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go.&#013;&#013;But he was far too proud for that. &#x201c;If you find your mothers,&#x201d; he said darkly, &#x201c;I hope you will like them.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were they not noodles to want to go?&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now then,&#x201d; cried Peter, &#x201c;no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;&#x201d; and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for he had something important to do.&#013;&#013;She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would prefer a thimble.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?&#x201d; she said, lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And you will take your medicine?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter, however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. &#x201c;Are you ready, Tinker Bell?&#x201d; he called out.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then lead the way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 12 THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF&#013;The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.&#013;&#013;By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.&#013;&#013;That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.&#013;&#013;The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children's home, awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.&#013;&#013;Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with no policy but to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot helplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.&#013;&#013;Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father's sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx [dense formation] that would have been hard to break had they risen quickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.&#013;&#013;It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.&#013;&#013;To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell [deadly] genius with which it was carried out.&#013;&#013;What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance.&#013;&#013;The night's work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chiefly Pan.&#013;&#013;Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's hatred of him. True he had flung Hook's arm to the crocodile, but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the crocodile's pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not&#x2014;. There is no beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter's cockiness.&#013;&#013;This had got on Hook's nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at night it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.&#013;&#013;The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.&#013;&#013;In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate.&#013;&#013;Which side had won?&#013;&#013;The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter's answer.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If the redskins have won,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;they will beat the tom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it. &#x201c;You will never hear the tom-tom again,&#x201d; he muttered, but inaudibly of course, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admired Hook so much.&#013;&#013;Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The tom-tom,&#x201d; the miscreants heard Peter cry; &#x201c;an Indian victory!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?&#013;The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.&#013;&#013;A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, he was so frightfully DISTINGUE [imposingly distinguished], that she was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a little girl.&#013;&#013;Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly's secret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter's life.&#013;&#013;They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly's turn came, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.&#013;&#013;Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.&#013;&#013;How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don't know whether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.&#013;&#013;Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast.&#013;&#013;The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that it provided him with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree, with his dagger in his hand?&#013;&#013;There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.&#013;&#013;He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.&#013;&#013;Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.&#013;&#013;Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.&#013;&#013;Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.&#013;&#013;What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept. The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook's heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.&#013;&#013;Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?&#013;&#013;But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.&#013;&#013;Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.&#013;&#013;Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup. His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees.&#013;&#013;Peter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.&#013;&#013;Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For long there was no answer: then again the knock.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;No answer.&#013;&#013;He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached the door. Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture [opening], so that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I won't open unless you speak,&#x201d; Peter cried.&#013;&#013;Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let me in, Peter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her face flushed and her dress stained with mud.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, you could never guess!&#x201d; she cried, and offered him three guesses. &#x201c;Out with it!&#x201d; he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from their mouths, she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys.&#013;&#013;Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'll rescue her!&#x201d; he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his medicine.&#013;&#013;His hand closed on the fatal draught.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is poisoned.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hook.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't be silly. How could Hook have got down here?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly's tree. Nevertheless Hook's words had left no room for doubt. The cup was poisoned.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; said Peter, quite believing himself, &#x201c;I never fell asleep.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained it to the dregs.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is the matter with you?&#x201d; cried Peter, suddenly afraid.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was poisoned, Peter,&#x201d; she told him softly; &#x201c;and now I am going to be dead.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Tink, did you drink it to save me?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But why, Tink?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear &#x201c;You silly ass,&#x201d; and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.&#013;&#013;His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.&#013;&#013;Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies.&#013;&#013;Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Do you believe?&#x201d; he cried.&#013;&#013;Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.&#013;&#013;She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she wasn't sure.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; she asked Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If you believe,&#x201d; he shouted to them, &#x201c;clap your hands; don't let Tink die.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Many clapped.&#013;&#013;Some didn't.&#013;&#013;A few beasts hissed.&#013;&#013;The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And now to rescue Wendy!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.&#013;&#013;He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.&#013;&#013;There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily he was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.&#013;&#013;The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or stalking him from behind.&#013;&#013;He swore this terrible oath: &#x201c;Hook or me this time.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 14 THE PIRATE SHIP&#013;One green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in the water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull, every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the horror of her name.&#013;&#013;She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook's tears and made it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.&#013;&#013;A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma [putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook's reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.&#013;&#013;Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his success?&#013;&#013;But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.&#013;&#013;He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferior to him.&#013;&#013;Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [attacked] her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school's distinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form.&#013;&#013;Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this is all that really matters.&#013;&#013;From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep. &#x201c;Have you been good form to-day?&#x201d; was their eternal question.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,&#x201d; he cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?&#x201d; the tap-tap from his school replied.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,&#x201d; he urged, &#x201c;and Flint feared Barbecue.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Barbecue, Flint&#x2014;what house?&#x201d; came the cutting retort.&#013;&#013;Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about good form?&#013;&#013;His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.&#013;&#013;Ah, envy not Hook.&#013;&#013;There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [death]. It was as if Peter's terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Better for Hook,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;if he had had less ambition!&#x201d; It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No little children to love me!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him.&#013;&#013;Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on his spectacles.&#013;&#013;To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it, but it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself&#x2014;&#x201c;Good form?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of all?&#013;&#013;He remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].&#013;&#013;With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee's head; but he did not tear. What arrested him was this reflection:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Bad form!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and he fell forward like a cut flower.&#013;&#013;His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which brought him to his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed over him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Quiet, you scugs,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;or I'll cast anchor in you;&#x201d; and at once the din was hushed. &#x201c;Are all the children chained, so that they cannot fly away?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then hoist them up.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now then, bullies,&#x201d; he said briskly, &#x201c;six of you walk the plank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't irritate him unnecessarily,&#x201d; had been Wendy's instructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant use of it.&#013;&#013;So Tootles explained prudently, &#x201c;You see, sir, I don't think my mother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, &#x201c;I don't think so,&#x201d; as if he wished things had been otherwise. &#x201c;Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Twin?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't think so,&#x201d; said the first twin, as clever as the others. &#x201c;Nibs, would&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Stow this gab,&#x201d; roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. &#x201c;You, boy,&#x201d; he said, addressing John, &#x201c;you look as if you had a little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,&#x201d; he said diffidently.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do you think, Michael?&#x201d; asked John.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What would you call me if I join?&#x201d; Michael demanded.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Blackbeard Joe.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Michael was naturally impressed. &#x201c;What do you think, John?&#x201d; He wanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?&#x201d; John inquired.&#013;&#013;Through Hook's teeth came the answer: &#x201c;You would have to swear, 'Down with the King.'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then I refuse,&#x201d; he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And I refuse,&#x201d; cried Michael.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Rule Britannia!&#x201d; squeaked Curly.&#013;&#013;The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out, &#x201c;That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up.&#013;&#013;No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger &#x201c;Dirty pig&#x201d;; and she had already written it on several. But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So, my beauty,&#x201d; said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, &#x201c;you are to see your children walk the plank.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Are they to die?&#x201d; asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They are,&#x201d; he snarled. &#x201c;Silence all,&#x201d; he called gloatingly, &#x201c;for a mother's last words to her children.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;At this moment Wendy was grand. &#x201c;These are my last words, dear boys,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers, and it is this: 'We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen.'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, &#x201c;I am going to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What my mother hopes. John, what are&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But Hook had found his voice again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tie her up!&#x201d; he shouted.&#013;&#013;It was Smee who tied her to the mast. &#x201c;See here, honey,&#x201d; he whispered, &#x201c;I'll save you if you promise to be my mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. &#x201c;I would almost rather have no children at all,&#x201d; she said disdainfully [scornfully].&#013;&#013;It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.&#013;&#013;Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead.&#013;&#013;It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.&#013;&#013;They all heard it&#x2014;pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.&#013;&#013;Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.&#013;&#013;The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought, &#x201c;The crocodile is about to board the ship!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hide me!&#x201d; he cried hoarsely.&#013;&#013;They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.&#013;&#013;Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid. It was Peter.&#013;&#013;He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 15 &#x201c;HOOK OR ME THIS TIME&#x201d;&#013;Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don't know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.&#013;&#013;Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.&#013;&#013;Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: &#x201c;Hook or me this time.&#x201d; He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.&#013;&#013;On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.&#013;&#013;The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. &#x201c;How clever of me!&#x201d; he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.&#013;&#013;It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken?&#013;&#013;&#x201c;One!&#x201d; (Slightly had begun to count.)&#013;&#013;None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round. They could hear each other's distressed breathing now, which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's gone, captain,&#x201d; Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. &#x201c;All's still again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then here's to Johnny Plank!&#x201d; he cried brazenly, hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the villainous ditty:&#013;&#013;     &#x201c;Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,&#013;     You walks along it so,&#013;     Till it goes down and you goes down&#013;     To Davy Jones below!&#x201d;&#013; &#013;To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he sang; and when he finished he cried, &#x201c;Do you want a touch of the cat [o' nine tails] before you walk the plank?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;At that they fell on their knees. &#x201c;No, no!&#x201d; they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Fetch the cat, Jukes,&#x201d; said Hook; &#x201c;it's in the cabin.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, ay,&#x201d; said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song, his dogs joining in with him:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,&#013;Its tails are nine, you know,&#013;And when they're writ upon your back&#x2014;&#x201d;&#013; &#013;What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; cried Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; said Slightly solemnly.&#013;&#013;The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin. He tottered out, haggard.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What's the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?&#x201d; hissed Hook, towering over him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The matter wi' him is he's dead, stabbed,&#x201d; replied Cecco in a hollow voice.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Bill Jukes dead!&#x201d; cried the startled pirates.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The cabin's as black as a pit,&#x201d; Cecco said, almost gibbering, &#x201c;but there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seen by Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Cecco,&#x201d; he said in his most steely voice, &#x201c;go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying &#x201c;No, no&#x201d;; but Hook was purring to his claw.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Did you say you would go, Cecco?&#x201d; he said musingly.&#013;&#013;Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow.&#013;&#013;No one spoke except Slightly. &#x201c;Three,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. &#x201c;'S'death and odds fish,&#x201d; he thundered, &#x201c;who is to bring me that doodle-doo?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Wait till Cecco comes out,&#x201d; growled Starkey, and the others took up the cry.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,&#x201d; said Hook, purring again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, by thunder!&#x201d; Starkey cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My hook thinks you did,&#x201d; said Hook, crossing to him. &#x201c;I wonder if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'll swing before I go in there,&#x201d; replied Starkey doggedly, and again he had the support of the crew.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is this mutiny?&#x201d; asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. &#x201c;Starkey's ringleader!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Captain, mercy!&#x201d; Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Shake hands, Starkey,&#x201d; said Hook, proffering his claw.&#013;&#013;Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Four,&#x201d; said Slightly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And now,&#x201d; Hook said courteously, &#x201c;did any other gentlemen say mutiny?&#x201d; Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, &#x201c;I'll bring out that doodle-doo myself,&#x201d; he said, and sped into the cabin.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Five.&#x201d; How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Something blew out the light,&#x201d; he said a little unsteadily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Something!&#x201d; echoed Mullins.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What of Cecco?&#x201d; demanded Noodler.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He's as dead as Jukes,&#x201d; said Hook shortly.&#013;&#013;His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and Cookson cried, &#x201c;They do say the surest sign a ship's accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I've heard,&#x201d; muttered Mullins, &#x201c;he always boards the pirate craft last. Had he a tail, captain?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;They say,&#x201d; said another, looking viciously at Hook, &#x201c;that when he comes it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Had he a hook, captain?&#x201d; asked Cookson insolently; and one after another took up the cry, &#x201c;The ship's doomed!&#x201d; At this the children could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lads,&#x201d; he cried to his crew, &#x201c;now here's a notion. Open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If they kill him, we're so much the better; if he kills them, we're none the worse.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now, listen!&#x201d; cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for the reappearance of Peter.&#013;&#013;She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy's bonds, and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, &#x201c;Hook or me this time.&#x201d; So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.&#013;&#013;To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lads,&#x201d; he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never quailing for an instant, &#x201c;I've thought it out. There's a Jonah aboard.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay,&#x201d; they snarled, &#x201c;a man wi' a hook.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi' a woman on board. We'll right the ship when she's gone.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint's. &#x201c;It's worth trying,&#x201d; they said doubtfully.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Fling the girl overboard,&#x201d; cried Hook; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There's none can save you now, missy,&#x201d; Mullins hissed jeeringly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There's one,&#x201d; replied the figure.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who's that?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter Pan the avenger!&#x201d; came the terrible answer; and as he spoke Peter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who 'twas that had been undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.&#013;&#013;At last he cried, &#x201c;Cleave him to the brisket!&#x201d; but without conviction.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Down, boys, and at them!&#x201d; Peter's voice rang out; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting&#x2014;five&#x2014;six&#x2014;seven eight&#x2014;nine&#x2014;ten&#x2014;eleven.&#013;&#013;I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Put up your swords, boys,&#x201d; cried the newcomer, &#x201c;this man is mine.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others drew back and formed a ring around them.&#013;&#013;For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So, Pan,&#x201d; said Hook at last, &#x201c;this is all your doing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ay, James Hook,&#x201d; came the stern answer, &#x201c;it is all my doing.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Proud and insolent youth,&#x201d; said Hook, &#x201c;prepare to meet thy doom.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Dark and sinister man,&#x201d; Peter answered, &#x201c;have at thee.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe's defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook's hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Now!&#x201d; cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.&#013;&#013;Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions assailed him now.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Pan, who and what art thou?&#x201d; he cried huskily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'm youth, I'm joy,&#x201d; Peter answered at a venture, &#x201c;I'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;To't again,&#x201d; he cried despairingly.&#013;&#013;He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.&#013;&#013;Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever.&#013;&#013;Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;In two minutes,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;the ship will be blown to pieces.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now, now, he thought, true form will show.&#013;&#013;But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands, and calmly flung it overboard.&#013;&#013;What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster] for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his socks were right.&#013;&#013;James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.&#013;&#013;For we have come to his last moment.&#013;&#013;Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.&#013;&#013;He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.&#013;&#013;At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Bad form,&#x201d; he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.&#013;&#013;Thus perished James Hook.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Seventeen,&#x201d; Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared.&#013;&#013;Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook's cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said &#x201c;half-past one!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME&#013;By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps [legs]; for there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo'sun, was among them, with a rope's end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.&#013;&#013;It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars [sailors] before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle. Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for the mainland.&#013;&#013;Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, after which it would save time to fly.&#013;&#013;Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin [one person after another, as they had to Cpt. Hook]. Instant obedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some of Hook's wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.&#013;&#013;Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, &#x201c;Don't be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children.&#x201d; So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to [bet on] that.&#013;&#013;Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.&#013;&#013;One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They have been planning it out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, Nana's leap through the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, &#x201c;Dash it all, here are those boys again.&#x201d; However, we should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by telling you what's what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, if you look at it in that way!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What other way is there in which to look at it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of them will hurt.&#013;&#013;The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling's dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, my own one, this is the place for me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave up doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways.&#013;&#013;Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into the kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.&#013;&#013;Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he must have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside.&#013;&#013;It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited him to dinner and added, &#x201c;Do come in the kennel.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting George's return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won't be able to say nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children, she couldn't help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are on the way. Let's.&#013;&#013;It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and there is no one in the room but Nana.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistress's lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.&#013;&#013;He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Listen to them,&#x201d; he said; &#x201c;it is very gratifying.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lots of little boys,&#x201d; sneered Liza.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There were several adults to-day,&#x201d; he assured her with a faint flush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her. Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But if I had been a weak man,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good heavens, if I had been a weak man!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And, George,&#x201d; she said timidly, &#x201c;you are as full of remorse as ever, aren't you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a kennel.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But it is punishment, isn't it, George? You are sure you are not enjoying it?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My love!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he curled round in the kennel.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Won't you play me to sleep,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;on the nursery piano?&#x201d; and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, &#x201c;And shut that window. I feel a draught.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open for them, always, always.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.&#013;&#013;Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.&#013;&#013;Peter's first words tell all.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Quick Tink,&#x201d; he whispered, &#x201c;close the window; bar it! That's right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.&#013;&#013;Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink, &#x201c;It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes bragged about her.&#013;&#013;He did not know the tune, which was &#x201c;Home, Sweet Home,&#x201d; but he knew it was saying, &#x201c;Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy&#x201d;; and he cried exultantly, &#x201c;You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on her eyes.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She wants me to unbar the window,&#x201d; thought Peter, &#x201c;but I won't, not I!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken their place.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She's awfully fond of Wendy,&#x201d; he said to himself. He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.&#013;&#013;The reason was so simple: &#x201c;I'm fond of her too. We can't both have her, lady.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him, knocking.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, all right,&#x201d; he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the window. &#x201c;Come on, Tink,&#x201d; he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature; &#x201c;we don't want any silly mothers;&#x201d; and he flew away.&#013;&#013;Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his home.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John,&#x201d; he said, looking around him doubtfully, &#x201c;I think I have been here before.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So it is,&#x201d; Michael said, but not with much conviction.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I say,&#x201d; cried John, &#x201c;the kennel!&#x201d; and he dashed across to look into it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps Nana is inside it,&#x201d; Wendy said.&#013;&#013;But John whistled. &#x201c;Hullo,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;there's a man inside it.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's father!&#x201d; exclaimed Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let me see father,&#x201d; Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look. &#x201c;He is not so big as the pirate I killed,&#x201d; he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.&#013;&#013;Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Surely,&#x201d; said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, &#x201c;he used not to sleep in the kennel?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John,&#x201d; Wendy said falteringly, &#x201c;perhaps we don't remember the old life as well as we thought we did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is very careless of mother,&#x201d; said that young scoundrel John, &#x201c;not to be here when we come back.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It's mother!&#x201d; cried Wendy, peeping.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So it is!&#x201d; said John.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?&#x201d; asked Michael, who was surely sleepy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear!&#x201d; exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse [for having gone], &#x201c;it was quite time we came back.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let us creep in,&#x201d; John suggested, &#x201c;and put our hands over her eyes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had a better plan.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as if we had never been away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still.&#013;&#013;She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had nursed them.&#013;&#013;They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mother!&#x201d; Wendy cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That's Wendy,&#x201d; she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mother!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That's John,&#x201d; she said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Mother!&#x201d; cried Michael. He knew her now.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That's Michael,&#x201d; she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed and run to her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;George, George!&#x201d; she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP&#013;I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.&#013;&#013;Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather large number.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I must say,&#x201d; he said to Wendy, &#x201c;that you don't do things by halves,&#x201d; a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.&#013;&#013;The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, &#x201c;Do you think we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go away.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Father!&#x201d; Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We could lie doubled up,&#x201d; said Nibs.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I always cut their hair myself,&#x201d; said Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;George!&#x201d; Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light.&#013;&#013;Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher [zero] in his own house.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't think he is a cypher,&#x201d; Tootles cried instantly. &#x201c;Do you think he is a cypher, Curly?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, I don't. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Rather not. Twin, what do you think?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;We'll fit in, sir,&#x201d; they assured him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Then follow the leader,&#x201d; he cried gaily. &#x201c;Mind you, I am not sure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same. Hoop la!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried &#x201c;Hoop la!&#x201d; and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget whether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted in.&#013;&#013;As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh dear, are you going away?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You don't feel, Peter,&#x201d; she said falteringly, &#x201c;that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;About me, Peter?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would like to adopt him also.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Would you send me to school?&#x201d; he inquired craftily.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And then to an office?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I suppose so.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Soon I would be a man?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Very soon.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't want to go to school and learn solemn things,&#x201d; he told her passionately. &#x201c;I don't want to be a man. O Wendy's mother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; said Wendy the comforter, &#x201c;I should love you in a beard;&#x201d; and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But where are you going to live?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;How lovely,&#x201d; cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her grip.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I thought all the fairies were dead,&#x201d; Mrs. Darling said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There are always a lot of young ones,&#x201d; explained Wendy, who was now quite an authority, &#x201c;because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall have such fun,&#x201d; said Peter, with eye on Wendy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It will be rather lonely in the evening,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;sitting by the fire.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I shall have Tink.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round,&#x201d; she reminded him a little tartly.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Sneaky tell-tale!&#x201d; Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It doesn't matter,&#x201d; Peter said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Peter, you know it matters.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Well, then, come with me to the little house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;May I, mummy?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But he does so need a mother.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;So do you, my love.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Oh, all right,&#x201d; Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You won't forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time comes?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling's kiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.&#013;&#013;Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor [the younger Jenkins]. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the English double-deckers]; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.&#013;&#013;Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.&#013;&#013;She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Who is Captain Hook?&#x201d; he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Don't you remember,&#x201d; she asked, amazed, &#x201c;how you killed him and saved all our lives?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I forget them after I kill them,&#x201d; he replied carelessly.&#013;&#013;When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said, &#x201c;Who is Tinker Bell?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Peter,&#x201d; she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not remember.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;There are such a lot of them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I expect she is no more.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;I expect he was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them.&#013;&#013;Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.&#013;&#013;Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet; but he never came.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Perhaps he is ill,&#x201d; Michael said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You know he is never ill.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, &#x201c;Perhaps there is no such person, Wendy!&#x201d; and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying.&#013;&#013;Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year.&#013;&#013;That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls.&#013;&#013;All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver [train engineer]. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children was once John.&#013;&#013;Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [formal announcement of a marriage].&#013;&#013;Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash.&#013;&#013;She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was Jane's nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per cents [mortgage rate] from Wendy's father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.&#013;&#013;There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself.&#013;&#013;Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy's part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What do we see now?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I don't think I see anything to-night,&#x201d; says Wendy, with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, you do,&#x201d; says Jane, &#x201c;you see when you were a little girl.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is a long time ago, sweetheart,&#x201d; says Wendy. &#x201c;Ah me, how time flies!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Does it fly,&#x201d; asks the artful child, &#x201c;the way you flew when you were a little girl?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, you did.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The dear old days when I could fly!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why can't you fly now, mother?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the way.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Why do they forget the way?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do believe,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;that it is this nursery.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I do believe it is,&#x201d; says Jane. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The foolish fellow,&#x201d; says Wendy, &#x201c;tried to stick it on with soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You have missed a bit,&#x201d; interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better than her mother. &#x201c;When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did you say?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I sat up in bed and I said, 'Boy, why are you crying?'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, that was it,&#x201d; says Jane, with a big breath.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids' lagoon, and the home under the ground, and the little house.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes! which did you like best of all?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;The last thing he ever said to me was, 'Just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;But, alas, he forgot all about me,&#x201d; Wendy said it with a smile. She was as grown up as that.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What did his crow sound like?&#x201d; Jane asked one evening.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It was like this,&#x201d; Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter's crow.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, it wasn't,&#x201d; Jane said gravely, &#x201c;it was like this;&#x201d; and she did it ever so much better than her mother.&#013;&#013;Wendy was a little startled. &#x201c;My darling, how can you know?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I often hear it when I am sleeping,&#x201d; Jane said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only one who heard it awake.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Lucky you,&#x201d; said Jane.&#013;&#013;And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.&#013;&#013;He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth.&#013;&#013;He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo, Wendy,&#x201d; he said, not noticing any difference, for he was thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo, Peter,&#x201d; she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible. Something inside her was crying &#x201c;Woman, Woman, let go of me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo, where is John?&#x201d; he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;John is not here now,&#x201d; she gasped.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Is Michael asleep?&#x201d; he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;That is not Michael,&#x201d; she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her.&#013;&#013;Peter looked. &#x201c;Hullo, is it a new one?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boy or girl?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Girl.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; she said, faltering, &#x201c;are you expecting me to fly away with you?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Of course; that is why I have come.&#x201d; He added a little sternly, &#x201c;Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I can't come,&#x201d; she said apologetically, &#x201c;I have forgotten how to fly.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I'll soon teach you again.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he cried, shrinking.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I will turn up the light,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and then you can see for yourself.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid. &#x201c;Don't turn up the light,&#x201d; he cried.&#013;&#013;She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were wet-eyed smiles.&#013;&#013;Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he cried again.&#013;&#013;She had to tell him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long ago.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You promised not to!&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I couldn't help it. I am a married woman, Peter.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, you're not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, she's not.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room to try to think.&#013;&#013;Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and was interested at once.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Boy,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;why are you crying?&#x201d;&#013;&#013;Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo,&#x201d; he said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Hullo,&#x201d; said Jane.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;My name is Peter Pan,&#x201d; he told her.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;I came back for my mother,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;to take her to the Neverland.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I know,&#x201d; Jane said, &#x201c;I have been waiting for you.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;She is my mother,&#x201d; Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;He does so need a mother,&#x201d; Jane said.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Yes, I know,&#x201d; Wendy admitted rather forlornly; &#x201c;no one knows it so well as I.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;Good-bye,&#x201d; said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about.&#013;&#013;Wendy rushed to the window.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; she cried.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;It is just for spring cleaning time,&#x201d; Jane said, &#x201c;he wants me always to do his spring cleaning.&#x201d;&#013;&#013;&#x201c;If only I could go with you,&#x201d; Wendy sighed.&#013;&#013;&#x201c;You see you can't fly,&#x201d; said Jane.&#013;&#013;Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars.&#013;&#013;As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter's mother in turn; and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.&#013;&#013;THE END",

        "content": "I&#013;I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various kinds, noting the essential quality of each; to inquire into the structure of the plot as requisite to a good poem; into the number and nature of the parts of which a poem is composed; and similarly into whatever else falls within the same inquiry. Following, then, the order of nature, let us begin with the principles which come first.&#013;&#013;Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic: poetry, and the music of the flute and of the lyre in most of their forms, are all in their general conception modes of imitation. They differ, however, from one: another in three respects,&#x2014;the medium, the objects, the manner or mode of imitation, being in each case distinct.&#013;&#013;For as there are persons who, by conscious art or mere habit, imitate and represent various objects through the medium of colour and form, or again by the voice; so in the arts above mentioned, taken as a whole, the imitation is produced by rhythm, language, or 'harmony,' either singly or combined.&#013;&#013;Thus in the music of the flute and of the lyre, 'harmony' and rhythm alone are employed; also in other arts, such as that of the shepherd's pipe, which are essentially similar to these. In dancing, rhythm alone is used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates character, emotion, and action, by rhythmical movement.&#013;&#013;There is another art which imitates by means of language alone, and that either in prose or verse&#x2014;which, verse, again, may either combine different metres or consist of but one kind&#x2014;but this has hitherto been without a name. For there is no common term we could apply to the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues on the one hand; and, on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic, elegiac, or any similar metre. People do, indeed, add the word 'maker' or 'poet' to the name of the metre, and speak of elegiac poets, or epic (that is, hexameter) poets, as if it were not the imitation that makes the poet, but the verse that entitles them all indiscriminately to the name. Even when a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the author; and yet Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common but the metre, so that it would be right to call the one poet, the other physicist rather than poet. On the same principle, even if a writer in his poetic imitation were to combine all metres, as Chaeremon did in his Centaur, which is a medley composed of metres of all kinds, we should bring him too under the general term poet. So much then for these distinctions.&#013;&#013;There are, again, some arts which employ all the means above mentioned, namely, rhythm, tune, and metre. Such are Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, and also Tragedy and Comedy; but between them the difference is, that in the first two cases these means are all employed in combination, in the latter, now one means is employed, now another.&#013;&#013;Such, then, are the differences of the arts with respect to the medium of imitation.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;II&#013;Since the objects of imitation are men in action, and these men must be either of a higher or a lower type (for moral character mainly answers to these divisions, goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks of moral differences), it follows that we must represent men either as better than in real life, or as worse, or as they are. It is the same in painting. Polygnotus depicted men as nobler than they are, Pauson as less noble, Dionysius drew them true to life.&#013;&#013;Now it is evident that each of the modes of imitation above mentioned will exhibit these differences, and become a distinct kind in imitating objects that are thus distinct. Such diversities may be found even in dancing, flute-playing, and lyre-playing. So again in language, whether prose or verse unaccompanied by music. Homer, for example, makes men better than they are; Cleophon as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Deiliad, worse than they are. The same thing holds good of Dithyrambs and Nomes; here too one may portray different types, as Timotheus and Philoxenus differed in representing their Cyclopes. The same distinction marks off Tragedy from Comedy; for Comedy aims at representing men as worse, Tragedy as better than in actual life.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;III&#013;There is still a third difference&#x2014;the manner in which each of these objects may be imitated. For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration&#x2014;in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged&#x2014;or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us.&#013;&#013;These, then, as we said at the beginning, are the three differences which distinguish artistic imitation,&#x2014;the medium, the objects, and the manner. So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the same kind as Homer&#x2014;for both imitate higher types of character; from another point of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes&#x2014;for both imitate persons acting and doing. Hence, some say, the name of 'drama' is given to such poems, as representing action. For the same reason the Dorians claim the invention both of Tragedy and Comedy. The claim to Comedy is put forward by the Megarians,&#x2014;not only by those of Greece proper, who allege that it originated under their democracy, but also by the Megarians of Sicily, for the poet Epicharmus, who is much earlier than Chionides and Magnes, belonged to that country. Tragedy too is claimed by certain Dorians of the Peloponnese. In each case they appeal to the evidence of language. The outlying villages, they say, are by them called {kappa omega mu alpha iota}, by the Athenians {delta eta mu iota}: and they assume that Comedians were so named not from {kappa omega mu 'alpha zeta epsilon iota nu}, 'to revel,' but because they wandered from village to village (kappa alpha tau alpha / kappa omega mu alpha sigma), being excluded contemptuously from the city. They add also that the Dorian word for 'doing' is {delta rho alpha nu}, and the Athenian, {pi rho alpha tau tau epsilon iota nu}.&#013;&#013;This may suffice as to the number and nature of the various modes of imitation.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;IV&#013;Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of them lying deep in our nature. First, the instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood, one difference between him and other animals being that he is the most imitative of living creatures, and through imitation learns his earliest lessons; and no less universal is the pleasure felt in things imitated. We have evidence of this in the facts of experience. Objects which in themselves we view with pain, we delight to contemplate when reproduced with minute fidelity: such as the forms of the most ignoble animals and of dead bodies. The cause of this again is, that to learn gives the liveliest pleasure, not only to philosophers but to men in general; whose capacity, however, of learning is more limited. Thus the reason why men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they find themselves learning or inferring, and saying perhaps, 'Ah, that is he.' For if you happen not to have seen the original, the pleasure will be due not to the imitation as such, but to the execution, the colouring, or some such other cause.&#013;&#013;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, metres being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.&#013;&#013;Poetry now diverged in two directions, according to the individual character of the writers. The graver spirits imitated noble actions, and the actions of good men. The more trivial sort imitated the actions of meaner persons, at first composing satires, as the former did hymns to the gods and the praises of famous men. A poem of the satirical kind cannot indeed be put down to any author earlier than Homer; though many such writers probably there were. But from Homer onward, instances can be cited,&#x2014;his own Margites, for example, and other similar compositions. The appropriate metre was also here introduced; hence the measure is still called the iambic or lampooning measure, being that in which people lampooned one another. Thus the older poets were distinguished as writers of heroic or of lampooning verse.&#013;&#013;As, in the serious style, Homer is pre-eminent among poets, for he alone combined dramatic form with excellence of imitation, so he too first laid down the main lines of Comedy, by dramatising the ludicrous instead of writing personal satire. His Margites bears the same relation to Comedy that the Iliad and Odyssey do to Tragedy. But when Tragedy and Comedy came to light, the two classes of poets still followed their natural bent: the lampooners became writers of Comedy, and the Epic poets were succeeded by Tragedians, since the drama was a larger and higher form of art.&#013;&#013;Whether Tragedy has as yet perfected its proper types or not; and whether it is to be judged in itself, or in relation also to the audience,&#x2014;this raises another question. Be that as it may, Tragedy&#x2014;as also Comedy&#x2014;was at first mere improvisation. The one originated with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those of the phallic songs, which are still in use in many of our cities. Tragedy advanced by slow degrees; each new element that showed itself was in turn developed. Having passed through many changes, it found its natural form, and there it stopped.&#013;&#013;Aeschylus first introduced a second actor; he diminished the importance of the Chorus, and assigned the leading part to the dialogue. Sophocles raised the number of actors to three, and added scene-painting. Moreover, it was not till late that the short plot was discarded for one of greater compass, and the grotesque diction of the earlier satyric form for the stately manner of Tragedy. The iambic measure then replaced the trochaic tetrameter, which was originally employed when the poetry was of the Satyric order, and had greater affinities with dancing. Once dialogue had come in, Nature herself discovered the appropriate measure. For the iambic is, of all measures, the most colloquial: we see it in the fact that conversational speech runs into iambic lines more frequently than into any other kind of verse; rarely into hexameters, and only when we drop the colloquial intonation. The additions to the number of 'episodes' or acts, and the other accessories of which tradition; tells, must be taken as already described; for to discuss them in detail would, doubtless, be a large undertaking.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;V&#013;Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters of a lower type, not, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the Ludicrous being merely a subdivision of the ugly. It consists in some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive. To take an obvious example, the comic mask is ugly and distorted, but does not imply pain.&#013;&#013;The successive changes through which Tragedy passed, and the authors of these changes, are well known, whereas Comedy has had no history, because it was not at first treated seriously. It was late before the Archon granted a comic chorus to a poet; the performers were till then voluntary. Comedy had already taken definite shape when comic poets, distinctively so called, are heard of. Who furnished it with masks, or prologues, or increased the number of actors,&#x2014;these and other similar details remain unknown. As for the plot, it came originally from Sicily; but of Athenian writers Crates was the first who, abandoning the 'iambic' or lampooning form, generalised his themes and plots.&#013;&#013;Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time. This, then, is a second point of difference; though at first the same freedom was admitted in Tragedy as in Epic poetry.&#013;&#013;Of their constituent parts some are common to both, some peculiar to Tragedy, whoever, therefore, knows what is good or bad Tragedy, knows also about Epic poetry. All the elements of an Epic poem are found in Tragedy, but the elements of a Tragedy are not all found in the Epic poem.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;VI&#013;Of the poetry which imitates in hexameter verse, and of Comedy, we will speak hereafter. Let us now discuss Tragedy, resuming its formal definition, as resulting from what has been already said.&#013;&#013;Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions. By 'language embellished,' I mean language into which rhythm, 'harmony,' and song enter. By 'the several kinds in separate parts,' I mean, that some parts are rendered through the medium of verse alone, others again with the aid of song.&#013;&#013;Now as tragic imitation implies persons acting, it necessarily follows, in the first place, that Spectacular equipment will be a part of Tragedy. Next, Song and Diction, for these are the medium of imitation. By 'Diction' I mean the mere metrical arrangement of the words: as for 'Song,' it is a term whose sense every one understands.&#013;&#013;Again, Tragedy is the imitation of an action; and an action implies personal agents, who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities both of character and thought; for it is by these that we qualify actions themselves, and these&#x2014;thought and character&#x2014;are the two natural causes from which actions spring, and on actions again all success or failure depends. Hence, the Plot is the imitation of the action: for by plot I here mean the arrangement of the incidents. By Character I mean that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to the agents. Thought is required wherever a statement is proved, or, it may be, a general truth enunciated. Every Tragedy, therefore, must have six parts, which parts determine its quality&#x2014;namely, Plot, Character, Diction, Thought, Spectacle, Song. Two of the parts constitute the medium of imitation, one the manner, and three the objects of imitation. And these complete the list. These elements have been employed, we may say, by the poets to a man; in fact, every play contains Spectacular elements as well as Character, Plot, Diction, Song, and Thought.&#013;&#013;But most important of all is the structure of the incidents. For Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life, and life consists in action, and its end is a mode of action, not a quality. Now character determines men's qualities, but it is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse. Dramatic action, therefore, is not with a view to the representation of character: character comes in as subsidiary to the actions. Hence the incidents and the plot are the end of a tragedy; and the end is the chief thing of all. Again, without action there cannot be a tragedy; there may be without character. The tragedies of most of our modern poets fail in the rendering of character; and of poets in general this is often true. It is the same in painting; and here lies the difference between Zeuxis and Polygnotus. Polygnotus delineates character well: the style of Zeuxis is devoid of ethical quality. Again, if you string together a set of speeches expressive of character, and well finished in point of diction and thought, you will not produce the essential tragic effect nearly so well as with a play which, however deficient in these respects, yet has a plot and artistically constructed incidents. Besides which, the most powerful elements of emotional: interest in Tragedy Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and Recognition scenes&#x2014;are parts of the plot. A further proof is, that novices in the art attain to finish: of diction and precision of portraiture before they can construct the plot. It is the same with almost all the early poets.&#013;&#013;The Plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were, the soul of a tragedy: Character holds the second place. A similar fact is seen in painting. The most beautiful colours, laid on confusedly, will not give as much pleasure as the chalk outline of a portrait. Thus Tragedy is the imitation of an action, and of the agents mainly with a view to the action.&#013;&#013;Third in order is Thought,&#x2014;that is, the faculty of saying what is possible and pertinent in given circumstances. In the case of oratory, this is the function of the Political art and of the art of rhetoric: and so indeed the older poets make their characters speak the language of civic life; the poets of our time, the language of the rhetoricians. Character is that which reveals moral purpose, showing what kind of things a man chooses or avoids. Speeches, therefore, which do not make this manifest, or in which the speaker does not choose or avoid anything whatever, are not expressive of character. Thought, on the other hand, is found where something is proved to be, or not to be, or a general maxim is enunciated.&#013;&#013;Fourth among the elements enumerated comes Diction; by which I mean, as has been already said, the expression of the meaning in words; and its essence is the same both in verse and prose.&#013;&#013;Of the remaining elements Song holds the chief place among the embellishments.&#013;&#013;The Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;VII&#013;These principles being established, let us now discuss the proper structure of the Plot, since this is the first and most important thing in Tragedy.&#013;&#013;Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude; for there may be a whole that is wanting in magnitude. A whole is that which has a beginning, a middle, and an end. A beginning is that which does not itself follow anything by causal necessity, but after which something naturally is or comes to be. An end, on the contrary, is that which itself naturally follows some other thing, either by necessity, or as a rule, but has nothing following it. A middle is that which follows something as some other thing follows it. A well constructed plot, therefore, must neither begin nor end at haphazard, but conform to these principles.&#013;&#013;Again, a beautiful object, whether it be a living organism or any whole composed of parts, must not only have an orderly arrangement of parts, but must also be of a certain magnitude; for beauty depends on magnitude and order. Hence a very small animal organism cannot be beautiful; for the view of it is confused, the object being seen in an almost imperceptible moment of time. Nor, again, can one of vast size be beautiful; for as the eye cannot take it all in at once, the unity and sense of the whole is lost for the spectator; as for instance if there were one a thousand miles long. As, therefore, in the case of animate bodies and organisms a certain magnitude is necessary, and a magnitude which may be easily embraced in one view; so in the plot, a certain length is necessary, and a length which can be easily embraced by the memory. The limit of length in relation to dramatic competition and sensuous presentment, is no part of artistic theory. For had it been the rule for a hundred tragedies to compete together, the performance would have been regulated by the water-clock,&#x2014;as indeed we are told was formerly done. But the limit as fixed by the nature of the drama itself is this: the greater the length, the more beautiful will the piece be by reason of its size, provided that the whole be perspicuous. And to define the matter roughly, we may say that the proper magnitude is comprised within such limits, that the sequence of events, according to the law of probability or necessity, will admit of a change from bad fortune to good, or from good fortune to bad.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;VIII&#013;Unity of plot does not, as some persons think, consist in the Unity of the hero. For infinitely various are the incidents in one man's life which cannot be reduced to unity; and so, too, there are many actions of one man out of which we cannot make one action. Hence, the error, as it appears, of all poets who have composed a Heracleid, a Theseid, or other poems of the kind. They imagine that as Heracles was one man, the story of Heracles must also be a unity. But Homer, as in all else he is of surpassing merit, here too&#x2014;whether from art or natural genius&#x2014;seems to have happily discerned the truth. In composing the Odyssey he did not include all the adventures of Odysseus&#x2014;such as his wound on Parnassus, or his feigned madness at the mustering of the host&#x2014;incidents between which there was no necessary or probable connection: but he made the Odyssey, and likewise the Iliad, to centre round an action that in our sense of the word is one. As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;IX&#013;It is, moreover, evident from what has been said, that it is not the function of the poet to relate what has happened, but what may happen,&#x2014;what is possible according to the law of probability or necessity. The poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or in prose. The work of Herodotus might be put into verse, and it would still be a species of history, with metre no less than without it. The true difference is that one relates what has happened, the other what may happen. Poetry, therefore, is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular. By the universal, I mean how a person of a certain type will on occasion speak or act, according to the law of probability or necessity; and it is this universality at which poetry aims in the names she attaches to the personages. The particular is&#x2014;for example&#x2014;what Alcibiades did or suffered. In Comedy this is already apparent: for here the poet first constructs the plot on the lines of probability, and then inserts characteristic names;&#x2014;unlike the lampooners who write about particular individuals. But tragedians still keep to real names, the reason being that what is possible is credible: what has not happened we do not at once feel sure to be possible: but what has happened is manifestly possible: otherwise it would not have happened. Still there are even some tragedies in which there are only one or two well known names, the rest being fictitious. In others, none are well known, as in Agathon's Antheus, where incidents and names alike are fictitious, and yet they give none the less pleasure. We must not, therefore, at all costs keep to the received legends, which are the usual subjects of Tragedy. Indeed, it would be absurd to attempt it; for even subjects that are known are known only to a few, and yet give pleasure to all. It clearly follows that the poet or 'maker' should be the maker of plots rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he imitates, and what he imitates are actions. And even if he chances to take an historical subject, he is none the less a poet; for there is no reason why some events that have actually happened should not conform to the law of the probable and possible, and in virtue of that quality in them he is their poet or maker.&#013;&#013;Of all plots and actions the epeisodic are the worst. I call a plot 'epeisodic' in which the episodes or acts succeed one another without probable or necessary sequence. Bad poets compose such pieces by their own fault, good poets, to please the players; for, as they write show pieces for competition, they stretch the plot beyond its capacity, and are often forced to break the natural continuity.&#013;&#013;But again, Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but of events inspiring fear or pity. Such an effect is best produced when the events come on us by surprise; and the effect is heightened when, at the same time, they follow as cause and effect. The tragic wonder will thee be greater than if they happened of themselves or by accident; for even coincidences are most striking when they have an air of design. We may instance the statue of Mitys at Argos, which fell upon his murderer while he was a spectator at a festival, and killed him. Such events seem not to be due to mere chance. Plots, therefore, constructed on these principles are necessarily the best.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;X&#013;Plots are either Simple or Complex, for the actions in real life, of which the plots are an imitation, obviously show a similar distinction. An action which is one and continuous in the sense above defined, I call Simple, when the change of fortune takes place without Reversal of the Situation and without Recognition.&#013;&#013;A Complex action is one in which the change is accompanied by such Reversal, or by Recognition, or by both. These last should arise from the internal structure of the plot, so that what follows should be the necessary or probable result of the preceding action. It makes all the difference whether any given event is a case of propter hoc or post hoc.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XI&#013;Reversal of the Situation is a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity. Thus in the Oedipus, the messenger comes to cheer Oedipus and free him from his alarms about his mother, but by revealing who he is, he produces the opposite effect. Again in the Lynceus, Lynceus is being led away to his death, and Danaus goes with him, meaning, to slay him; but the outcome of the preceding incidents is that Danaus is killed and Lynceus saved. Recognition, as the name indicates, is a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune. The best form of recognition is coincident with a Reversal of the Situation, as in the Oedipus. There are indeed other forms. Even inanimate things of the most trivial kind may in a sense be objects of recognition. Again, we may recognise or discover whether a person has done a thing or not. But the recognition which is most intimately connected with the plot and action is, as we have said, the recognition of persons. This recognition, combined, with Reversal, will produce either pity or fear; and actions producing these effects are those which, by our definition, Tragedy represents. Moreover, it is upon such situations that the issues of good or bad fortune will depend. Recognition, then, being between persons, it may happen that one person only is recognised by the other-when the latter is already known&#x2014;or it may be necessary that the recognition should be on both sides. Thus Iphigenia is revealed to Orestes by the sending of the letter; but another act of recognition is required to make Orestes known to Iphigenia.&#013;&#013;Two parts, then, of the Plot&#x2014;Reversal of the Situation and Recognition&#x2014;turn upon surprises. A third part is the Scene of Suffering. The Scene of Suffering is a destructive or painful action, such as death on the stage, bodily agony, wounds and the like.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XII&#013;[The parts of Tragedy which must be treated as elements of the whole have been already mentioned. We now come to the quantitative parts, and the separate parts into which Tragedy is divided, namely, Prologue, Episode, Exode, Choric song; this last being divided into Parode and Stasimon. These are common to all plays: peculiar to some are the songs of actors from the stage and the Commoi.&#013;&#013;The Prologue is that entire part of a tragedy which precedes the Parode of the Chorus. The Episode is that entire part of a tragedy which is between complete choric songs. The Exode is that entire part of a tragedy which has no choric song after it. Of the Choric part the Parode is the first undivided utterance of the Chorus: the Stasimon is a Choric ode without anapaests or trochaic tetrameters: the Commos is a joint lamentation of Chorus and actors. The parts of Tragedy which must be treated as elements of the whole have been already mentioned. The quantitative parts the separate parts into which it is divided&#x2014;are here enumerated.]&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XIII&#013;As the sequel to what has already been said, we must proceed to consider what the poet should aim at, and what he should avoid, in constructing his plots; and by what means the specific effect of Tragedy will be produced.&#013;&#013;A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change, of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear. Nor, again, should the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited. A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will be neither pitiful nor terrible. There remains, then, the character between these two extremes,&#x2014;that of a man who is not eminently good and just,-yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous,&#x2014;a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.&#013;&#013;A well constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. The practice of the stage bears out our view. At first the poets recounted any legend that came in their way. Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses, on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art should be of this construction. Hence they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect; and Euripides, faulty though he may be in the general management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most tragic of the poets.&#013;&#013;In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies&#x2014;like Orestes and Aegisthus&#x2014;quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XIV&#013;Fear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means; but they may also result from the inner structure of the piece, which is the better way, and indicates a superior poet. For the plot ought to be so constructed that, even without the aid of the eye, he who hears the tale told will thrill with horror and melt to pity at what takes place. This is the impression we should receive from hearing the story of the Oedipus. But to produce this effect by the mere spectacle is a less artistic method, and dependent on extraneous aids. Those who employ spectacular means to create a sense not of the terrible but only of the monstrous, are strangers to the purpose of Tragedy; for we must not demand of Tragedy any and every kind of pleasure, but only that which is proper to it. And since the pleasure which the poet should afford is that which comes from pity and fear through imitation, it is evident that this quality must be impressed upon the incidents.&#013;&#013;Let us then determine what are the circumstances which strike us as terrible or pitiful.&#013;&#013;Actions capable of this effect must happen between persons who are either friends or enemies or indifferent to one another. If an enemy kills an enemy, there is nothing to excite pity either in the act or the intention,&#x2014;except so far as the suffering in itself is pitiful. So again with indifferent persons. But when the tragic incident occurs between those who are near or dear to one another&#x2014;if, for example, a brother kills, or intends to kill, a brother, a son his father, a mother her son, a son his mother, or any other deed of the kind is done&#x2014;these are the situations to be looked for by the poet. He may not indeed destroy the framework of the received legends&#x2014;the fact, for instance, that Clytemnestra was slain by Orestes and Eriphyle by Alcmaeon but he ought to show invention of his own, and skilfully handle the traditional material. Let us explain more clearly what is meant by skilful handling.&#013;&#013;The action may be done consciously and with knowledge of the persons, in the manner of the older poets. It is thus too that Euripides makes Medea slay her children. Or, again, the deed of horror may be done, but done in ignorance, and the tie of kinship or friendship be discovered afterwards. The Oedipus of Sophocles is an example. Here, indeed, the incident is outside the drama proper; but cases occur where it falls within the action of the play: one may cite the Alcmaeon of Astydamas, or Telegonus in the Wounded Odysseus. Again, there is a third case,&#x2014; (to be about to act with knowledge of the persons and then not to act. The fourth case is) when some one is about to do an irreparable deed through ignorance, and makes the discovery before it is done. These are the only possible ways. For the deed must either be done or not done,&#x2014;and that wittingly or unwittingly. But of all these ways, to be about to act knowing the persons, and then not to act, is the worst. It is shocking without being tragic, for no disaster follows. It is, therefore, never, or very rarely, found in poetry. One instance, however, is in the Antigone, where Haemon threatens to kill Creon. The next and better way is that the deed should be perpetrated. Still better, that it should be perpetrated in ignorance, and the discovery made afterwards. There is then nothing to shock us, while the discovery produces a startling effect. The last case is the best, as when in the Cresphontes Merope is about to slay her son, but, recognising who he is, spares his life. So in the Iphigenia, the sister recognises the brother just in time. Again in the Helle, the son recognises the mother when on the point of giving her up. This, then, is why a few families only, as has been already observed, furnish the subjects of tragedy. It was not art, but happy chance, that led the poets in search of subjects to impress the tragic quality upon their plots. They are compelled, therefore, to have recourse to those houses whose history contains moving incidents like these.&#013;&#013;Enough has now been said concerning the structure of the incidents, and the right kind of plot.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XV&#013;In respect of Character there are four things to be aimed at. First, and most important, it must be good. Now any speech or action that manifests moral purpose of any kind will be expressive of character: the character will be good if the purpose is good. This rule is relative to each class. Even a woman may be good, and also a slave; though the woman may be said to be an inferior being, and the slave quite worthless. The second thing to aim at is propriety. There is a type of manly valour; but valour in a woman, or unscrupulous cleverness, is inappropriate. Thirdly, character must be true to life: for this is a distinct thing from goodness and propriety, as here described. The fourth point is consistency: for though the subject of the imitation, who suggested the type, be inconsistent, still he must be consistently inconsistent. As an example of motiveless degradation of character, we have Menelaus in the Orestes: of character indecorous and inappropriate, the lament of Odysseus in the Scylla, and the speech of Melanippe: of inconsistency, the Iphigenia at Aulis,&#x2014;for Iphigenia the suppliant in no way resembles her later self.&#013;&#013;As in the structure of the plot, so too in the portraiture of character, the poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable. Thus a person of a given character should speak or act in a given way, by the rule either of necessity or of probability; just as this event should follow that by necessary or probable sequence. It is therefore evident that the unravelling of the plot, no less than the complication, must arise out of the plot itself, it must not be brought about by the 'Deus ex Machina'&#x2014;as in the Medea, or in the Return of the Greeks in the Iliad. The 'Deus ex Machina' should be employed only for events external to the drama,&#x2014;for antecedent or subsequent events, which lie beyond the range of human knowledge, and which require to be reported or foretold; for to the gods we ascribe the power of seeing all things. Within the action there must be nothing irrational. If the irrational cannot be excluded, it should be outside the scope of the tragedy. Such is the irrational element in the Oedipus of Sophocles.&#013;&#013;Again, since Tragedy is an imitation of persons who are above the common level, the example of good portrait-painters should be followed. They, while reproducing the distinctive form of the original, make a likeness which is true to life and yet more beautiful. So too the poet, in representing men who are irascible or indolent, or have other defects of character, should preserve the type and yet ennoble it. In this way Achilles is portrayed by Agathon and Homer.&#013;&#013;These then are rules the poet should observe. Nor should he neglect those appeals to the senses, which, though not among the essentials, are the concomitants of poetry; for here too there is much room for error. But of this enough has been said in our published treatises.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XVI&#013;What Recognition is has been already explained. We will now enumerate its kinds.&#013;&#013;First, the least artistic form, which, from poverty of wit, is most commonly employed recognition by signs. Of these some are congenital,&#x2014;such as 'the spear which the earth-born race bear on their bodies,' or the stars introduced by Carcinus in his Thyestes. Others are acquired after birth; and of these some are bodily marks, as scars; some external tokens, as necklaces, or the little ark in the Tyro by which the discovery is effected. Even these admit of more or less skilful treatment. Thus in the recognition of Odysseus by his scar, the discovery is made in one way by the nurse, in another by the swineherds. The use of tokens for the express purpose of proof&#x2014;and, indeed, any formal proof with or without tokens&#x2014;is a less artistic mode of recognition. A better kind is that which comes about by a turn of incident, as in the Bath Scene in the Odyssey.&#013;&#013;Next come the recognitions invented at will by the poet, and on that account wanting in art. For example, Orestes in the Iphigenia reveals the fact that he is Orestes. She, indeed, makes herself known by the letter; but he, by speaking himself, and saying what the poet, not what the plot requires. This, therefore, is nearly allied to the fault above mentioned:&#x2014;for Orestes might as well have brought tokens with him. Another similar instance is the 'voice of the shuttle' in the Tereus of Sophocles.&#013;&#013;The third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object awakens a feeling: as in the Cyprians of Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks into tears on seeing the picture; or again in the 'Lay of Alcinous,' where Odysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the past and weeps; and hence the recognition.&#013;&#013;The fourth kind is by process of reasoning. Thus in the Choephori: 'Some one resembling me has come: no one resembles me but Orestes: therefore Orestes has come.' Such too is the discovery made by Iphigenia in the play of Polyidus the Sophist. It was a natural reflection for Orestes to make, 'So I too must die at the altar like my sister.' So, again, in the Tydeus of Theodectes, the father says, 'I came to find my son, and I lose my own life.' So too in the Phineidae: the women, on seeing the place, inferred their fate:&#x2014;'Here we are doomed to die, for here we were cast forth.' Again, there is a composite kind of recognition involving false inference on the part of one of the characters, as in the Odysseus Disguised as a Messenger. A said (that no one else was able to bend the bow;... hence B (the disguised Odysseus) imagined that A would) recognise the bow which, in fact, he had not seen; and to bring about a recognition by this means that the expectation A would recognise the bow is false inference.&#013;&#013;But, of all recognitions, the best is that which arises from the incidents themselves, where the startling discovery is made by natural means. Such is that in the Oedipus of Sophocles, and in the Iphigenia; for it was natural that Iphigenia should wish to dispatch a letter. These recognitions alone dispense with the artificial aid of tokens or amulets. Next come the recognitions by process of reasoning.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XVII&#013;In constructing the plot and working it out with the proper diction, the poet should place the scene, as far as possible, before his eyes. In this way, seeing everything with the utmost vividness, as if he were a spectator of the action, he will discover what is in keeping with it, and be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies. The need of such a rule is shown by the fault found in Carcinus. Amphiaraus was on his way from the temple. This fact escaped the observation of one who did not see the situation. On the stage, however, the piece failed, the audience being offended at the oversight.&#013;&#013;Again, the poet should work out his play, to the best of his power, with appropriate gestures; for those who feel emotion are most convincing through natural sympathy with the characters they represent; and one who is agitated storms, one who is angry rages, with the most life-like reality. Hence poetry implies either a happy gift of nature or a strain of madness. In the one case a man can take the mould of any character; in the other, he is lifted out of his proper self.&#013;&#013;As for the story, whether the poet takes it ready made or constructs it for himself, he should first sketch its general outline, and then fill in the episodes and amplify in detail. The general plan may be illustrated by the Iphigenia. A young girl is sacrificed; she disappears mysteriously from the eyes of those who sacrificed her; She is transported to another country, where the custom is to offer up all strangers to the goddess. To this ministry she is appointed. Some time later her own brother chances to arrive. The fact that the oracle for some reason ordered him to go there, is outside the general plan of the play. The purpose, again, of his coming is outside the action proper. However, he comes, he is seized, and, when on the point of being sacrificed, reveals who he is. The mode of recognition may be either that of Euripides or of Polyidus, in whose play he exclaims very naturally:&#x2014;'So it was not my sister only, but I too, who was doomed to be sacrificed'; and by that remark he is saved.&#013;&#013;After this, the names being once given, it remains to fill in the episodes. We must see that they are relevant to the action. In the case of Orestes, for example, there is the madness which led to his capture, and his deliverance by means of the purificatory rite. In the drama, the episodes are short, but it is these that give extension to Epic poetry. Thus the story of the Odyssey can be stated briefly. A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon, and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight&#x2014;suitors are wasting his substance and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tost, he himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is himself preserved while he destroys them. This is the essence of the plot; the rest is episode.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XVIII&#013;Every tragedy falls into two parts,&#x2014;Complication and Unravelling or Denouement. Incidents extraneous to the action are frequently combined with a portion of the action proper, to form the Complication; the rest is the Unravelling. By the Complication I mean all that extends from the beginning of the action to the part which marks the turning-point to good or bad fortune. The Unravelling is that which extends from the beginning of the change to the end. Thus, in the Lynceus of Theodectes, the Complication consists of the incidents presupposed in the drama, the seizure of the child, and then again, The Unravelling extends from the accusation of murder to the end.&#013;&#013;There are four kinds of Tragedy, the Complex, depending entirely on Reversal of the Situation and Recognition; the Pathetic (where the motive is passion),&#x2014;such as the tragedies on Ajax and Ixion; the Ethical (where the motives are ethical),&#x2014;such as the Phthiotides and the Peleus. The fourth kind is the Simple (We here exclude the purely spectacular element), exemplified by the Phorcides, the Prometheus, and scenes laid in Hades. The poet should endeavour, if possible, to combine all poetic elements; or failing that, the greatest number and those the most important; the more so, in face of the cavilling criticism of the day. For whereas there have hitherto been good poets, each in his own branch, the critics now expect one man to surpass all others in their several lines of excellence.&#013;&#013;In speaking of a tragedy as the same or different, the best test to take is the plot. Identity exists where the Complication and Unravelling are the same. Many poets tie the knot well, but unravel it ill. Both arts, however, should always be mastered.&#013;&#013;Again, the poet should remember what has been often said, and not make an Epic structure into a Tragedy&#x2014;by an Epic structure I mean one with a multiplicity of plots&#x2014;as if, for instance, you were to make a tragedy out of the entire story of the Iliad. In the Epic poem, owing to its length, each part assumes its proper magnitude. In the drama the result is far from answering to the poet's expectation. The proof is that the poets who have dramatised the whole story of the Fall of Troy, instead of selecting portions, like Euripides; or who have taken the whole tale of Niobe, and not a part of her story, like Aeschylus, either fail utterly or meet with poor success on the stage. Even Agathon has been known to fail from this one defect. In his Reversals of the Situation, however, he shows a marvellous skill in the effort to hit the popular taste,&#x2014;to produce a tragic effect that satisfies the moral sense. This effect is produced when the clever rogue, like Sisyphus, is outwitted, or the brave villain defeated. Such an event is probable in Agathon's sense of the word: 'it is probable,' he says, 'that many things should happen contrary to probability.'&#013;&#013;The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action, in the manner not of Euripides but of Sophocles. As for the later poets, their choral songs pertain as little to the subject of the piece as to that of any other tragedy. They are, therefore, sung as mere interludes, a practice first begun by Agathon. Yet what difference is there between introducing such choral interludes, and transferring a speech, or even a whole act, from one play to another?&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XIX&#013;It remains to speak of Diction and Thought, the other parts of Tragedy having been already discussed. Concerning Thought, we may assume what is said in the Rhetoric, to which inquiry the subject more strictly belongs. Under Thought is included every effect which has to be produced by speech, the subdivisions being,&#x2014;proof and refutation; the excitation of the feelings, such as pity, fear, anger, and the like; the suggestion of importance or its opposite. Now, it is evident that the dramatic incidents must be treated from the same points of view as the dramatic speeches, when the object is to evoke the sense of pity, fear, importance, or probability. The only difference is, that the incidents should speak for themselves without verbal exposition; while the effects aimed at in speech should be produced by the speaker, and as a result of the speech. For what were the business of a speaker, if the Thought were revealed quite apart from what he says?&#013;&#013;Next, as regards Diction. One branch of the inquiry treats of the Modes of Utterance. But this province of knowledge belongs to the art of Delivery and to the masters of that science. It includes, for instance,&#x2014;what is a command, a prayer, a statement, a threat, a question, an answer, and so forth. To know or not to know these things involves no serious censure upon the poet's art. For who can admit the fault imputed to Homer by Protagoras,&#x2014;that in the words, 'Sing, goddess, of the wrath,' he gives a command under the idea that he utters a prayer? For to tell some one to do a thing or not to do it is, he says, a command. We may, therefore, pass this over as an inquiry that belongs to another art, not to poetry.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XX&#013;[Language in general includes the following parts:&#x2014;Letter, Syllable, Connecting word, Noun, Verb, Inflexion or Case, Sentence or Phrase.&#013;&#013;A Letter is an indivisible sound, yet not every such sound, but only one which can form part of a group of sounds. For even brutes utter indivisible sounds, none of which I call a letter. The sound I mean may be either a vowel, a semi-vowel, or a mute. A vowel is that which without impact of tongue or lip has an audible sound. A semi-vowel, that which with such impact has an audible sound, as S and R. A mute, that which with such impact has by itself no sound, but joined to a vowel sound becomes audible, as G and D. These are distinguished according to the form assumed by the mouth and the place where they are produced; according as they are aspirated or smooth, long or short; as they are acute, grave, or of an intermediate tone; which inquiry belongs in detail to the writers on metre.&#013;&#013;A Syllable is a non-significant sound, composed of a mute and a vowel: for GR without A is a syllable, as also with A,&#x2014;GRA. But the investigation of these differences belongs also to metrical science.&#013;&#013;A Connecting word is a non-significant sound, which neither causes nor hinders the union of many sounds into one significant sound; it may be placed at either end or in the middle of a sentence. Or, a non-significant sound, which out of several sounds, each of them significant, is capable of forming one significant sound,&#x2014;as {alpha mu theta iota}, {pi epsilon rho iota}, and the like. Or, a non-significant sound, which marks the beginning, end, or division of a sentence; such, however, that it cannot correctly stand by itself at the beginning of a sentence, as {mu epsilon nu}, {eta tau omicron iota}, {delta epsilon}.&#013;&#013;A Noun is a composite significant sound, not marking time, of which no part is in itself significant: for in double or compound words we do not employ the separate parts as if each were in itself significant. Thus in Theodorus, 'god-given,' the {delta omega rho omicron nu} or 'gift' is not in itself significant.&#013;&#013;A Verb is a composite significant sound, marking time, in which, as in the noun, no part is in itself significant. For 'man,' or 'white' does not express the idea of 'when'; but 'he walks,' or 'he has walked' does connote time, present or past.&#013;&#013;Inflexion belongs both to the noun and verb, and expresses either the relation 'of,' 'to,' or the like; or that of number, whether one or many, as 'man' or 'men '; or the modes or tones in actual delivery, e.g. a question or a command. 'Did he go?' and 'go' are verbal inflexions of this kind.&#013;&#013;A Sentence or Phrase is a composite significant sound, some at least of whose parts are in themselves significant; for not every such group of words consists of verbs and nouns&#x2014;'the definition of man,' for example&#x2014;but it may dispense even with the verb. Still it will always have some significant part, as 'in walking,' or 'Cleon son of Cleon.' A sentence or phrase may form a unity in two ways,&#x2014;either as signifying one thing, or as consisting of several parts linked together. Thus the Iliad is one by the linking together of parts, the definition of man by the unity of the thing signified.]&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XXI&#013;Words are of two kinds, simple and double. By simple I mean those composed of non-significant elements, such as {gamma eta}. By double or compound, those composed either of a significant and non-significant element (though within the whole word no element is significant), or of elements that are both significant. A word may likewise be triple, quadruple, or multiple in form, like so many Massilian expressions, e.g. 'Hermo-caico-xanthus who prayed to Father Zeus&gt;.'&#013;&#013;Every word is either current, or strange, or metaphorical, or ornamental, or newly-coined, or lengthened, or contracted, or altered.&#013;&#013;By a current or proper word I mean one which is in general use among a people; by a strange word, one which is in use in another country. Plainly, therefore, the same word may be at once strange and current, but not in relation to the same people. The word {sigma iota gamma upsilon nu omicron nu}, 'lance,' is to the Cyprians a current term but to us a strange one.&#013;&#013;Metaphor is the application of an alien name by transference either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, or by analogy, that is, proportion. Thus from genus to species, as: 'There lies my ship'; for lying at anchor is a species of lying. From species to genus, as: 'Verily ten thousand noble deeds hath Odysseus wrought'; for ten thousand is a species of large number, and is here used for a large number generally. From species to species, as: 'With blade of bronze drew away the life,' and 'Cleft the water with the vessel of unyielding bronze.' Here {alpha rho upsilon rho alpha iota}, 'to draw away,' is used for {tau alpha mu epsilon iota nu}, 'to cleave,' and {tau alpha mu epsilon iota nu} again for {alpha rho upsilon alpha iota},&#x2014;each being a species of taking away. Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth. Sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup may, therefore, be called 'the shield of Dionysus,' and the shield 'the cup of Ares.' Or, again, as old age is to life, so is evening to day. Evening may therefore be called 'the old age of the day,' and old age, 'the evening of life,' or, in the phrase of Empedocles, 'life's setting sun.' For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet 'sowing the god-created light.' There is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; as if we were to call the shield, not 'the cup of Ares,' but 'the wineless cup.'&#013;&#013;{An ornamental word...}&#013;&#013;A newly-coined word is one which has never been even in local use, but is adopted by the poet himself. Some such words there appear to be: as {epsilon rho nu upsilon gamma epsilon sigma}, 'sprouters,' for {kappa epsilon rho alpha tau alpha}, 'horns,' and {alpha rho eta tau eta rho}, 'supplicator,' for {iota epsilon rho epsilon upsilon sigma}, 'priest.'&#013;&#013;A word is lengthened when its own vowel is exchanged for a longer one, or when a syllable is inserted. A word is contracted when some part of it is removed. Instances of lengthening are,&#x2014;{pi omicron lambda eta omicron sigma} for {pi omicron lambda epsilon omega sigma}, and {Pi eta lambda eta iota alpha delta epsilon omega} for {Pi eta lambda epsilon iota delta omicron upsilon}: of contraction,&#x2014;{kappa rho iota}, {delta omega}, and {omicron psi}, as in {mu iota alpha / gamma iota nu epsilon tau alpha iota / alpha mu phi omicron tau episilon rho omega nu / omicron psi}.&#013;&#013;An altered word is one in which part of the ordinary form is left unchanged, and part is re-cast; as in {delta epsilon xi iota-tau epsilon rho omicron nu / kappa alpha tau alpha / mu alpha zeta omicron nu}, {delta epsilon xi iota tau epsilon rho omicron nu} is for {delta epsilon xi iota omicron nu}.&#013;&#013;[Nouns in themselves are either masculine, feminine, or neuter. Masculine are such as end in {nu}, {rho}, {sigma}, or in some letter compounded with {sigma},&#x2014;these being two, and {xi}. Feminine, such as end in vowels that are always long, namely {eta} and {omega}, and&#x2014;of vowels that admit of lengthening&#x2014;those in {alpha}. Thus the number of letters in which nouns masculine and feminine end is the same; for {psi} and {xi} are equivalent to endings in {sigma}. No noun ends in a mute or a vowel short by nature. Three only end in {iota},&#x2014;{mu eta lambda iota}, {kappa omicron mu mu iota}, {pi epsilon pi epsilon rho iota}: five end in {upsilon}. Neuter nouns end in these two latter vowels; also in {nu} and {sigma}.]&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XXII&#013;The perfection of style is to be clear without being mean. The clearest style is that which uses only current or proper words; at the same time it is mean:&#x2014;witness the poetry of Cleophon and of Sthenelus. That diction, on the other hand, is lofty and raised above the commonplace which employs unusual words. By unusual, I mean strange (or rare) words, metaphorical, lengthened,&#x2014;anything, in short, that differs from the normal idiom. Yet a style wholly composed of such words is either a riddle or a jargon; a riddle, if it consists of metaphors; a jargon, if it consists of strange (or rare) words. For the essence of a riddle is to express true facts under impossible combinations. Now this cannot be done by any arrangement of ordinary words, but by the use of metaphor it can. Such is the riddle:&#x2014;'A man I saw who on another man had glued the bronze by aid of fire,' and others of the same kind. A diction that is made up of strange (or rare) terms is a jargon. A certain infusion, therefore, of these elements is necessary to style; for the strange (or rare) word, the metaphorical, the ornamental, and the other kinds above mentioned, will raise it above the commonplace and mean, while the use of proper words will make it perspicuous. But nothing contributes more to produce a clearness of diction that is remote from commonness than the lengthening, contraction, and alteration of words. For by deviating in exceptional cases from the normal idiom, the language will gain distinction; while, at the same time, the partial conformity with usage will give perspicuity. The critics, therefore, are in error who censure these licenses of speech, and hold the author up to ridicule. Thus Eucleides, the elder, declared that it would be an easy matter to be a poet if you might lengthen syllables at will. He caricatured the practice in the very form of his diction, as in the verse: '{Epsilon pi iota chi alpha rho eta nu / epsilon iota delta omicron nu / Mu alpha rho alpha theta omega nu alpha delta epsilon / Beta alpha delta iota zeta omicron nu tau alpha}, or, {omicron upsilon kappa / alpha nu / gamma / epsilon rho alpha mu epsilon nu omicron sigma / tau omicron nu / epsilon kappa epsilon iota nu omicron upsilon /epsilon lambda lambda epsilon beta omicron rho omicron nu}. To employ such license at all obtrusively is, no doubt, grotesque; but in any mode of poetic diction there must be moderation. Even metaphors, strange (or rare) words, or any similar forms of speech, would produce the like effect if used without propriety and with the express purpose of being ludicrous. How great a difference is made by the appropriate use of lengthening, may be seen in Epic poetry by the insertion of ordinary forms in the verse. So, again, if we take a strange (or rare) word, a metaphor, or any similar mode of expression, and replace it by the current or proper term, the truth of our observation will be manifest. For example Aeschylus and Euripides each composed the same iambic line. But the alteration of a single word by Euripides, who employed the rarer term instead of the ordinary one, makes one verse appear beautiful and the other trivial. Aeschylus in his Philoctetes says: {Phi alpha gamma epsilon delta alpha iota nu alpha / delta / eta / mu omicron upsilon / sigma alpha rho kappa alpha sigma / epsilon rho theta iota epsilon iota / pi omicron delta omicron sigma}.&#013;&#013;Euripides substitutes {Theta omicron iota nu alpha tau alpha iota} 'feasts on' for {epsilon sigma theta iota epsilon iota} 'feeds on.' Again, in the line, {nu upsilon nu / delta epsilon / mu /epsilon omega nu / omicron lambda iota gamma iota gamma upsilon sigma / tau epsilon / kappa alpha iota / omicron upsilon tau iota delta alpha nu omicron sigma / kappa alpha iota / alpha epsilon iota kappa eta sigma), the difference will be felt if we substitute the common words, {nu upsilon nu / delta epsilon / mu / epsilon omega nu / mu iota kappa rho omicron sigma / tau epsilon / kappa alpha iota / alpha rho theta epsilon nu iota kappa omicron sigma / kappa alpha iota / alpha epsilon iota delta gamma sigma}. Or, if for the line, {delta iota phi rho omicron nu / alpha epsilon iota kappa epsilon lambda iota omicron nu / kappa alpha tau alpha theta epsilon iota sigma / omicron lambda iota gamma eta nu / tau epsilon / tau rho alpha pi epsilon iota sigma / omicron lambda iota gamma eta nu / tau epsilon / tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta alpha nu,} We read, {delta iota phi rho omicron nu / mu omicron chi theta eta rho omicron nu / kappa alpha tau alpha theta epsilon iota sigma / mu iota kappa rho alpha nu / tau epsilon / tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta alpha nu}.&#013;&#013;Or, for {eta iota omicron nu epsilon sigma / beta omicron omicron omega rho iota nu, eta iota omicron nu epsilon sigma kappa rho alpha zeta omicron upsilon rho iota nu}&#013;&#013;Again, Ariphrades ridiculed the tragedians for using phrases which no one would employ in ordinary speech: for example, {delta omega mu alpha tau omega nu / alpha pi omicron} instead of {alpha pi omicron / delta omega mu alpha tau omega nu}, {rho epsilon theta epsilon nu}, {epsilon gamma omega / delta epsilon / nu iota nu}, {Alpha chi iota lambda lambda epsilon omega sigma / pi epsilon rho iota} instead of {pi epsilon rho iota / 'Alpha chi iota lambda lambda epsilon omega sigma}, and the like. It is precisely because such phrases are not part of the current idiom that they give distinction to the style. This, however, he failed to see.&#013;&#013;It is a great matter to observe propriety in these several modes of expression, as also in compound words, strange (or rare) words, and so forth. But the greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor. This alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of genius, for to make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances.&#013;&#013;Of the various kinds of words, the compound are best adapted to Dithyrambs, rare words to heroic poetry, metaphors to iambic. In heroic poetry, indeed, all these varieties are serviceable. But in iambic verse, which reproduces, as far as may be, familiar speech, the most appropriate words are those which are found even in prose. These are,&#x2014;the current or proper, the metaphorical, the ornamental.&#013;&#013;Concerning Tragedy and imitation by means of action this may suffice.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XXIII&#013;As to that poetic imitation which is narrative in form and employs a single metre, the plot manifestly ought, as in a tragedy, to be constructed on dramatic principles. It should have for its subject a single action, whole and complete, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It will thus resemble a living organism in all its unity, and produce the pleasure proper to it. It will differ in structure from historical compositions, which of necessity present not a single action, but a single period, and all that happened within that period to one person or to many, little connected together as the events may be. For as the sea-fight at Salamis and the battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily took place at the same time, but did not tend to any one result, so in the sequence of events, one thing sometimes follows another, and yet no single result is thereby produced. Such is the practice, we may say, of most poets. Here again, then, as has been already observed, the transcendent excellence of Homer is manifest. He never attempts to make the whole war of Troy the subject of his poem, though that war had a beginning and an end. It would have been too vast a theme, and not easily embraced in a single view. If, again, he had kept it within moderate limits, it must have been over-complicated by the variety of the incidents. As it is, he detaches a single portion, and admits as episodes many events from the general story of the war&#x2014;such as the Catalogue of the ships and others&#x2014;thus diversifying the poem. All other poets take a single hero, a single period, or an action single indeed, but with a multiplicity of parts. Thus did the author of the Cypria and of the Little Iliad. For this reason the Iliad and the Odyssey each furnish the subject of one tragedy, or, at most, of two; while the Cypria supplies materials for many, and the Little Iliad for eight&#x2014;the Award of the Arms, the Philoctetes, the Neoptolemus, the Eurypylus, the Mendicant Odysseus, the Laconian Women, the Fall of Ilium, the Departure of the Fleet.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XXIV&#013;Again, Epic poetry must have as many kinds as Tragedy: it must be simple, or complex, or 'ethical,' or 'pathetic.' The parts also, with the exception of song and spectacle, are the same; for it requires Reversals of the Situation, Recognitions, and Scenes of Suffering. Moreover, the thoughts and the diction must be artistic. In all these respects Homer is our earliest and sufficient model. Indeed each of his poems has a twofold character. The Iliad is at once simple and 'pathetic,' and the Odyssey complex (for Recognition scenes run through it), and at the same time 'ethical.' Moreover, in diction and thought they are supreme.&#013;&#013;Epic poetry differs from Tragedy in the scale on which it is constructed, and in its metre. As regards scale or length, we have already laid down an adequate limit:&#x2014;the beginning and the end must be capable of being brought within a single view. This condition will be satisfied by poems on a smaller scale than the old epics, and answering in length to the group of tragedies presented at a single sitting.&#013;&#013;Epic poetry has, however, a great&#x2014;a special&#x2014;capacity for enlarging its dimensions, and we can see the reason. In Tragedy we cannot imitate several lines of actions carried on at one and the same time; we must confine ourselves to the action on the stage and the part taken by the players. But in Epic poetry, owing to the narrative form, many events simultaneously transacted can be presented; and these, if relevant to the subject, add mass and dignity to the poem. The Epic has here an advantage, and one that conduces to grandeur of effect, to diverting the mind of the hearer, and relieving the story with varying episodes. For sameness of incident soon produces satiety, and makes tragedies fail on the stage.&#013;&#013;As for the metre, the heroic measure has proved its fitness by the test of experience. If a narrative poem in any other metre or in many metres were now composed, it would be found incongruous. For of all measures the heroic is the stateliest and the most massive; and hence it most readily admits rare words and metaphors, which is another point in which the narrative form of imitation stands alone. On the other hand, the iambic and the trochaic tetrameter are stirring measures, the latter being akin to dancing, the former expressive of action. Still more absurd would it be to mix together different metres, as was done by Chaeremon. Hence no one has ever composed a poem on a great scale in any other than heroic verse. Nature herself, as we have said, teaches the choice of the proper measure.&#013;&#013;Homer, admirable in all respects, has the special merit of being the only poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself. The poet should speak as little as possible in his own person, for it is not this that makes him an imitator. Other poets appear themselves upon the scene throughout, and imitate but little and rarely. Homer, after a few prefatory words, at once brings in a man, or woman, or other personage; none of them wanting in characteristic qualities, but each with a character of his own.&#013;&#013;The element of the wonderful is required in Tragedy. The irrational, on which the wonderful depends for its chief effects, has wider scope in Epic poetry, because there the person acting is not seen. Thus, the pursuit of Hector would be ludicrous if placed upon the stage&#x2014;the Greeks standing still and not joining in the pursuit, and Achilles waving them back. But in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed. Now the wonderful is pleasing: as may be inferred from the fact that every one tells a story with some addition of his own, knowing that his hearers like it. It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skilfully. The secret of it lies in a fallacy, For, assuming that if one thing is or becomes, a second is or becomes, men imagine that, if the second is, the first likewise is or becomes. But this is a false inference. Hence, where the first thing is untrue, it is quite unnecessary, provided the second be true, to add that the first is or has become. For the mind, knowing the second to be true, falsely infers the truth of the first. There is an example of this in the Bath Scene of the Odyssey.&#013;&#013;Accordingly, the poet should prefer probable impossibilities to improbable possibilities. The tragic plot must not be composed of irrational parts. Everything irrational should, if possible, be excluded; or, at all events, it should lie outside the action of the play (as, in the Oedipus, the hero's ignorance as to the manner of Laius' death); not within the drama,&#x2014;as in the Electra, the messenger's account of the Pythian games; or, as in the Mysians, the man who has come from Tegea to Mysia and is still speechless. The plea that otherwise the plot would have been ruined, is ridiculous; such a plot should not in the first instance be constructed. But once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity. Take even the irrational incidents in the Odyssey, where Odysseus is left upon the shore of Ithaca. How intolerable even these might have been would be apparent if an inferior poet were to treat the subject. As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it.&#013;&#013;The diction should be elaborated in the pauses of the action, where there is no expression of character or thought. For, conversely, character and thought are merely obscured by a diction that is over brilliant.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XXV&#013;With respect to critical difficulties and their solutions, the number and nature of the sources from which they may be drawn may be thus exhibited.&#013;&#013;The poet being an imitator, like a painter or any other artist, must of necessity imitate one of three objects,&#x2014;things as they were or are, things as they are said or thought to be, or things as they ought to be. The vehicle of expression is language,&#x2014;either current terms or, it may be, rare words or metaphors. There are also many modifications of language, which we concede to the poets. Add to this, that the standard of correctness is not the same in poetry and politics, any more than in poetry and any other art. Within the art of poetry itself there are two kinds of faults, those which touch its essence, and those which are accidental. If a poet has chosen to imitate something, (but has imitated it incorrectly) through want of capacity, the error is inherent in the poetry. But if the failure is due to a wrong choice if he has represented a horse as throwing out both his off legs at once, or introduced technical inaccuracies in medicine, for example, or in any other art the error is not essential to the poetry. These are the points of view from which we should consider and answer the objections raised by the critics.&#013;&#013;First as to matters which concern the poet's own art. If he describes the impossible, he is guilty of an error; but the error may be justified, if the end of the art be thereby attained (the end being that already mentioned), if, that is, the effect of this or any other part of the poem is thus rendered more striking. A case in point is the pursuit of Hector. If, however, the end might have been as well, or better, attained without violating the special rules of the poetic art, the error is not justified: for every kind of error should, if possible, be avoided.&#013;&#013;Again, does the error touch the essentials of the poetic art, or some accident of it? For example,&#x2014;not to know that a hind has no horns is a less serious matter than to paint it inartistically.&#013;&#013;Further, if it be objected that the description is not true to fact, the poet may perhaps reply,&#x2014;'But the objects are as they ought to be': just as Sophocles said that he drew men as they ought to be; Euripides, as they are. In this way the objection may be met. If, however, the representation be of neither kind, the poet may answer,&#x2014;This is how men say the thing is.' This applies to tales about the gods. It may well be that these stories are not higher than fact nor yet true to fact: they are, very possibly, what Xenophanes says of them. But anyhow, 'this is what is said.' Again, a description may be no better than the fact: 'still, it was the fact'; as in the passage about the arms: 'Upright upon their butt-ends stood the spears.' This was the custom then, as it now is among the Illyrians.&#013;&#013;Again, in examining whether what has been said or done by some one is poetically right or not, we must not look merely to the particular act or saying, and ask whether it is poetically good or bad. We must also consider by whom it is said or done, to whom, when, by what means, or for what end; whether, for instance, it be to secure a greater good, or avert a greater evil.&#013;&#013;Other difficulties may be resolved by due regard to the usage of language. We may note a rare word, as in {omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma / mu epsilon nu / pi rho omega tau omicron nu}, where the poet perhaps employs {omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma} not in the sense of mules, but of sentinels. So, again, of Dolon: 'ill-favoured indeed he was to look upon.' It is not meant that his body was ill-shaped, but that his face was ugly; for the Cretans use the word {epsilon upsilon epsilon iota delta epsilon sigma}, 'well-favoured,' to denote a fair face. Again, {zeta omega rho omicron tau epsilon rho omicron nu / delta epsilon / kappa epsilon rho alpha iota epsilon}, 'mix the drink livelier,' does not mean `mix it stronger' as for hard drinkers, but 'mix it quicker.'&#013;&#013;Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were sleeping through the night,'&#x2014;while at the same time the poet says: 'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled at the sound of flutes and pipes.' 'All' is here used metaphorically for 'many,' all being a species of many. So in the verse,&#x2014;'alone she hath no part...,' {omicron iota eta}, 'alone,' is metaphorical; for the best known may be called the only one.&#013;&#013;Again, the solution may depend upon accent or breathing. Thus Hippias of Thasos solved the difficulties in the lines,&#x2014;{delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu (delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu) delta epsilon / omicron iota,} and { tau omicron / mu epsilon nu / omicron upsilon (omicron upsilon) kappa alpha tau alpha pi upsilon theta epsilon tau alpha iota / omicron mu beta rho omega}.&#013;&#013;Or again, the question may be solved by punctuation, as in Empedocles,&#x2014;'Of a sudden things became mortal that before had learnt to be immortal, and things unmixed before mixed.'&#013;&#013;Or again, by ambiguity of meaning,&#x2014;as {pi alpha rho omega chi eta kappa epsilon nu / delta epsilon / pi lambda epsilon omega / nu upsilon xi}, where the word {pi lambda epsilon omega} is ambiguous.&#013;&#013;Or by the usage of language. Thus any mixed drink is called {omicron iota nu omicron sigma}, 'wine.' Hence Ganymede is said 'to pour the wine to Zeus,' though the gods do not drink wine. So too workers in iron are called {chi alpha lambda kappa epsilon alpha sigma}, or workers in bronze. This, however, may also be taken as a metaphor.&#013;&#013;Again, when a word seems to involve some inconsistency of meaning, we should consider how many senses it may bear in the particular passage. For example: 'there was stayed the spear of bronze'&#x2014;we should ask in how many ways we may take 'being checked there.' The true mode of interpretation is the precise opposite of what Glaucon mentions. Critics, he says, jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their own fancy. The question about Icarius has been treated in this fashion. The critics imagine he was a Lacedaemonian. They think it strange, therefore, that Telemachus should not have met him when he went to Lacedaemon. But the Cephallenian story may perhaps be the true one. They allege that Odysseus took a wife from among themselves, and that her father was Icadius not Icarius. It is merely a mistake, then, that gives plausibility to the objection.&#013;&#013;In general, the impossible must be justified by reference to artistic requirements, or to the higher reality, or to received opinion. With respect to the requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to be preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible. Again, it may be impossible that there should be men such as Zeuxis painted. 'Yes,' we say, 'but the impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the reality.' To justify the irrational, we appeal to what is commonly said to be. In addition to which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to probability.'&#013;&#013;Things that sound contradictory should be examined by the same rules as in dialectical refutation whether the same thing is meant, in the same relation, and in the same sense. We should therefore solve the question by reference to what the poet says himself, or to what is tacitly assumed by a person of intelligence.&#013;&#013;The element of the irrational, and, similarly, depravity of character, are justly censured when there is no inner necessity for introducing them. Such is the irrational element in the introduction of Aegeus by Euripides and the badness of Menelaus in the Orestes.&#013;&#013;Thus, there are five sources from which critical objections are drawn. Things are censured either as impossible, or irrational, or morally hurtful, or contradictory, or contrary to artistic correctness. The answers should be sought under the twelve heads above mentioned.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XXVI&#013;The question may be raised whether the Epic or Tragic mode of imitation is the higher. If the more refined art is the higher, and the more refined in every case is that which appeals to the better sort of audience, the art which imitates anything and everything is manifestly most unrefined. The audience is supposed to be too dull to comprehend unless something of their own is thrown in by the performers, who therefore indulge in restless movements. Bad flute-players twist and twirl, if they have to represent 'the quoit-throw,' or hustle the coryphaeus when they perform the 'Scylla.' Tragedy, it is said, has this same defect. We may compare the opinion that the older actors entertained of their successors. Mynniscus used to call Callippides 'ape' on account of the extravagance of his action, and the same view was held of Pindarus. Tragic art, then, as a whole, stands to Epic in the same relation as the younger to the elder actors. So we are told that Epic poetry is addressed to a cultivated audience, who do not need gesture; Tragedy, to an inferior public. Being then unrefined, it is evidently the lower of the two.&#013;&#013;Now, in the first place, this censure attaches not to the poetic but to the histrionic art; for gesticulation may be equally overdone in epic recitation, as by Sosi-stratus, or in lyrical competition, as by Mnasitheus the Opuntian. Next, all action is not to be condemned any more than all dancing&#x2014;but only that of bad performers. Such was the fault found in Callippides, as also in others of our own day, who are censured for representing degraded women. Again, Tragedy like Epic poetry produces its effect even without action; it reveals its power by mere reading. If, then, in all other respects it is superior, this fault, we say, is not inherent in it.&#013;&#013;And superior it is, because it has all the epic elements&#x2014;it may even use the epic metre&#x2014;with the music and spectacular effects as important accessories; and these produce the most vivid of pleasures. Further, it has vividness of impression in reading as well as in representation. Moreover, the art attains its end within narrower limits; for the concentrated effect is more pleasurable than one which is spread over a long time and so diluted. What, for example, would be the effect of the Oedipus of Sophocles, if it were cast into a form as long as the Iliad? Once more, the Epic imitation has less unity; as is shown by this, that any Epic poem will furnish subjects for several tragedies. Thus if the story adopted by the poet has a strict unity, it must either be concisely told and appear truncated; or, if it conform to the Epic canon of length, it must seem weak and watery. (Such length implies some loss of unity,) if, I mean, the poem is constructed out of several actions, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have many such parts, each with a certain magnitude of its own. Yet these poems are as perfect as possible in structure; each is, in the highest degree attainable, an imitation of a single action.&#013;&#013;If, then, Tragedy is superior to Epic poetry in all these respects, and, moreover, fulfils its specific function better as an art for each art ought to produce, not any chance pleasure, but the pleasure proper to it, as already stated it plainly follows that Tragedy is the higher art, as attaining its end more perfectly.&#013;&#013;Thus much may suffice concerning Tragic and Epic poetry in general; their several kinds and parts, with the number of each and their differences; the causes that make a poem good or bad; the objections of the critics and the answers to these objections.&#013;&#013;",

        "content": "I&#013;An Early Fright&#013;&#013;In Styria, we, though by no means magnificent people, inhabit a castle, or schloss. A small income, in that part of the world, goes a great way. Eight or nine hundred a year does wonders. Scantily enough ours would have answered among wealthy people at home. My father is English, and I bear an English name, although I never saw England. But here, in this lonely and primitive place, where everything is so marvelously cheap, I really don't see how ever so much more money would at all materially add to our comforts, or even luxuries.&#013;&#013;My father was in the Austrian service, and retired upon a pension and his patrimony, and purchased this feudal residence, and the small estate on which it stands, a bargain.&#013;&#013;Nothing can be more picturesque or solitary. It stands on a slight eminence in a forest. The road, very old and narrow, passes in front of its drawbridge, never raised in my time, and its moat, stocked with perch, and sailed over by many swans, and floating on its surface white fleets of water lilies.&#013;&#013;Over all this the schloss shows its many-windowed front; its towers, and its Gothic chapel.&#013;&#013;The forest opens in an irregular and very picturesque glade before its gate, and at the right a steep Gothic bridge carries the road over a stream that winds in deep shadow through the wood. I have said that this is a very lonely place. Judge whether I say truth. Looking from the hall door towards the road, the forest in which our castle stands extends fifteen miles to the right, and twelve to the left. The nearest inhabited village is about seven of your English miles to the left. The nearest inhabited schloss of any historic associations, is that of old General Spielsdorf, nearly twenty miles away to the right.&#013;&#013;I have said &quot;the nearest inhabited village,&quot; because there is, only three miles westward, that is to say in the direction of General Spielsdorf's schloss, a ruined village, with its quaint little church, now roofless, in the aisle of which are the moldering tombs of the proud family of Karnstein, now extinct, who once owned the equally desolate chateau which, in the thick of the forest, overlooks the silent ruins of the town.&#013;&#013;Respecting the cause of the desertion of this striking and melancholy spot, there is a legend which I shall relate to you another time.&#013;&#013;I must tell you now, how very small is the party who constitute the inhabitants of our castle. I don't include servants, or those dependents who occupy rooms in the buildings attached to the schloss. Listen, and wonder! My father, who is the kindest man on earth, but growing old; and I, at the date of my story, only nineteen. Eight years have passed since then.&#013;&#013;I and my father constituted the family at the schloss. My mother, a Styrian lady, died in my infancy, but I had a good-natured governess, who had been with me from, I might almost say, my infancy. I could not remember the time when her fat, benignant face was not a familiar picture in my memory.&#013;&#013;This was Madame Perrodon, a native of Berne, whose care and good nature now in part supplied to me the loss of my mother, whom I do not even remember, so early I lost her. She made a third at our little dinner party. There was a fourth, Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, a lady such as you term, I believe, a &quot;finishing governess.&quot; She spoke French and German, Madame Perrodon French and broken English, to which my father and I added English, which, partly to prevent its becoming a lost language among us, and partly from patriotic motives, we spoke every day. The consequence was a Babel, at which strangers used to laugh, and which I shall make no attempt to reproduce in this narrative. And there were two or three young lady friends besides, pretty nearly of my own age, who were occasional visitors, for longer or shorter terms; and these visits I sometimes returned.&#013;&#013;These were our regular social resources; but of course there were chance visits from &quot;neighbors&quot; of only five or six leagues distance. My life was, notwithstanding, rather a solitary one, I can assure you.&#013;&#013;My gouvernantes had just so much control over me as you might conjecture such sage persons would have in the case of a rather spoiled girl, whose only parent allowed her pretty nearly her own way in everything.&#013;&#013;The first occurrence in my existence, which produced a terrible impression upon my mind, which, in fact, never has been effaced, was one of the very earliest incidents of my life which I can recollect. Some people will think it so trifling that it should not be recorded here. You will see, however, by-and-by, why I mention it. The nursery, as it was called, though I had it all to myself, was a large room in the upper story of the castle, with a steep oak roof. I can't have been more than six years old, when one night I awoke, and looking round the room from my bed, failed to see the nursery maid. Neither was my nurse there; and I thought myself alone. I was not frightened, for I was one of those happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost stories, of fairy tales, and of all such lore as makes us cover up our heads when the door cracks suddenly, or the flicker of an expiring candle makes the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall, nearer to our faces. I was vexed and insulted at finding myself, as I conceived, neglected, and I began to whimper, preparatory to a hearty bout of roaring; when to my surprise, I saw a solemn, but very pretty face looking at me from the side of the bed. It was that of a young lady who was kneeling, with her hands under the coverlet. I looked at her with a kind of pleased wonder, and ceased whimpering. She caressed me with her hands, and lay down beside me on the bed, and drew me towards her, smiling; I felt immediately delightfully soothed, and fell asleep again. I was wakened by a sensation as if two needles ran into my breast very deep at the same moment, and I cried loudly. The lady started back, with her eyes fixed on me, and then slipped down upon the floor, and, as I thought, hid herself under the bed.&#013;&#013;I was now for the first time frightened, and I yelled with all my might and main. Nurse, nursery maid, housekeeper, all came running in, and hearing my story, they made light of it, soothing me all they could meanwhile. But, child as I was, I could perceive that their faces were pale with an unwonted look of anxiety, and I saw them look under the bed, and about the room, and peep under tables and pluck open cupboards; and the housekeeper whispered to the nurse: &quot;Lay your hand along that hollow in the bed; someone did lie there, so sure as you did not; the place is still warm.&quot;&#013;&#013;I remember the nursery maid petting me, and all three examining my chest, where I told them I felt the puncture, and pronouncing that there was no sign visible that any such thing had happened to me.&#013;&#013;The housekeeper and the two other servants who were in charge of the nursery, remained sitting up all night; and from that time a servant always sat up in the nursery until I was about fourteen.&#013;&#013;I was very nervous for a long time after this. A doctor was called in, he was pallid and elderly. How well I remember his long saturnine face, slightly pitted with smallpox, and his chestnut wig. For a good while, every second day, he came and gave me medicine, which of course I hated.&#013;&#013;The morning after I saw this apparition I was in a state of terror, and could not bear to be left alone, daylight though it was, for a moment.&#013;&#013;I remember my father coming up and standing at the bedside, and talking cheerfully, and asking the nurse a number of questions, and laughing very heartily at one of the answers; and patting me on the shoulder, and kissing me, and telling me not to be frightened, that it was nothing but a dream and could not hurt me.&#013;&#013;But I was not comforted, for I knew the visit of the strange woman was not a dream; and I was awfully frightened.&#013;&#013;I was a little consoled by the nursery maid's assuring me that it was she who had come and looked at me, and lain down beside me in the bed, and that I must have been half-dreaming not to have known her face. But this, though supported by the nurse, did not quite satisfy me.&#013;&#013;I remembered, in the course of that day, a venerable old man, in a black cassock, coming into the room with the nurse and housekeeper, and talking a little to them, and very kindly to me; his face was very sweet and gentle, and he told me they were going to pray, and joined my hands together, and desired me to say, softly, while they were praying, &quot;Lord hear all good prayers for us, for Jesus' sake.&quot; I think these were the very words, for I often repeated them to myself, and my nurse used for years to make me say them in my prayers.&#013;&#013;I remembered so well the thoughtful sweet face of that white-haired old man, in his black cassock, as he stood in that rude, lofty, brown room, with the clumsy furniture of a fashion three hundred years old about him, and the scanty light entering its shadowy atmosphere through the small lattice. He kneeled, and the three women with him, and he prayed aloud with an earnest quavering voice for, what appeared to me, a long time. I forget all my life preceding that event, and for some time after it is all obscure also, but the scenes I have just described stand out vivid as the isolated pictures of the phantasmagoria surrounded by darkness.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;II&#013;&#013;A Guest&#013;&#013;I am now going to tell you something so strange that it will require all your faith in my veracity to believe my story. It is not only true, nevertheless, but truth of which I have been an eyewitness.&#013;&#013;It was a sweet summer evening, and my father asked me, as he sometimes did, to take a little ramble with him along that beautiful forest vista which I have mentioned as lying in front of the schloss.&#013;&#013;&quot;General Spielsdorf cannot come to us so soon as I had hoped,&quot; said my father, as we pursued our walk.&#013;&#013;He was to have paid us a visit of some weeks, and we had expected his arrival next day. He was to have brought with him a young lady, his niece and ward, Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt, whom I had never seen, but whom I had heard described as a very charming girl, and in whose society I had promised myself many happy days. I was more disappointed than a young lady living in a town, or a bustling neighborhood can possibly imagine. This visit, and the new acquaintance it promised, had furnished my day dream for many weeks.&#013;&#013;&quot;And how soon does he come?&quot; I asked.&#013;&#013;&quot;Not till autumn. Not for two months, I dare say,&quot; he answered. &quot;And I am very glad now, dear, that you never knew Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;And why?&quot; I asked, both mortified and curious.&#013;&#013;&quot;Because the poor young lady is dead,&quot; he replied. &quot;I quite forgot I had not told you, but you were not in the room when I received the General's letter this evening.&quot;&#013;&#013;I was very much shocked. General Spielsdorf had mentioned in his first letter, six or seven weeks before, that she was not so well as he would wish her, but there was nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion of danger.&#013;&#013;&quot;Here is the General's letter,&quot; he said, handing it to me. &quot;I am afraid he is in great affliction; the letter appears to me to have been written very nearly in distraction.&quot;&#013;&#013;We sat down on a rude bench, under a group of magnificent lime trees. The sun was setting with all its melancholy splendor behind the sylvan horizon, and the stream that flows beside our home, and passes under the steep old bridge I have mentioned, wound through many a group of noble trees, almost at our feet, reflecting in its current the fading crimson of the sky. General Spielsdorf's letter was so extraordinary, so vehement, and in some places so self-contradictory, that I read it twice over--the second time aloud to my father--and was still unable to account for it, except by supposing that grief had unsettled his mind.&#013;&#013;It said &quot;I have lost my darling daughter, for as such I loved her. During the last days of dear Bertha's illness I was not able to write to you.&#013;&#013;Before then I had no idea of her danger. I have lost her, and now learn all, too late. She died in the peace of innocence, and in the glorious hope of a blessed futurity. The fiend who betrayed our infatuated hospitality has done it all. I thought I was receiving into my house innocence, gaiety, a charming companion for my lost Bertha. Heavens! what a fool have I been!&#013;&#013;I thank God my child died without a suspicion of the cause of her sufferings. She is gone without so much as conjecturing the nature of her illness, and the accursed passion of the agent of all this misery. I devote my remaining days to tracking and extinguishing a monster. I am told I may hope to accomplish my righteous and merciful purpose. At present there is scarcely a gleam of light to guide me. I curse my conceited incredulity, my despicable affectation of superiority, my blindness, my obstinacy--all--too late. I cannot write or talk collectedly now. I am distracted. So soon as I shall have a little recovered, I mean to devote myself for a time to enquiry, which may possibly lead me as far as Vienna. Some time in the autumn, two months hence, or earlier if I live, I will see you--that is, if you permit me; I will then tell you all that I scarce dare put upon paper now. Farewell. Pray for me, dear friend.&quot;&#013;&#013;In these terms ended this strange letter. Though I had never seen Bertha Rheinfeldt my eyes filled with tears at the sudden intelligence; I was startled, as well as profoundly disappointed.&#013;&#013;The sun had now set, and it was twilight by the time I had returned the General's letter to my father.&#013;&#013;It was a soft clear evening, and we loitered, speculating upon the possible meanings of the violent and incoherent sentences which I had just been reading. We had nearly a mile to walk before reaching the road that passes the schloss in front, and by that time the moon was shining brilliantly. At the drawbridge we met Madame Perrodon and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, who had come out, without their bonnets, to enjoy the exquisite moonlight.&#013;&#013;We heard their voices gabbling in animated dialogue as we approached. We joined them at the drawbridge, and turned about to admire with them the beautiful scene.&#013;&#013;The glade through which we had just walked lay before us. At our left the narrow road wound away under clumps of lordly trees, and was lost to sight amid the thickening forest. At the right the same road crosses the steep and picturesque bridge, near which stands a ruined tower which once guarded that pass; and beyond the bridge an abrupt eminence rises, covered with trees, and showing in the shadows some grey ivy-clustered rocks.&#013;&#013;Over the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist was stealing like smoke, marking the distances with a transparent veil; and here and there we could see the river faintly flashing in the moonlight.&#013;&#013;No softer, sweeter scene could be imagined. The news I had just heard made it melancholy; but nothing could disturb its character of profound serenity, and the enchanted glory and vagueness of the prospect.&#013;&#013;My father, who enjoyed the picturesque, and I, stood looking in silence over the expanse beneath us. The two good governesses, standing a little way behind us, discoursed upon the scene, and were eloquent upon the moon.&#013;&#013;Madame Perrodon was fat, middle-aged, and romantic, and talked and sighed poetically. Mademoiselle De Lafontaine--in right of her father who was a German, assumed to be psychological, metaphysical, and something of a mystic--now declared that when the moon shone with a light so intense it was well known that it indicated a special spiritual activity. The effect of the full moon in such a state of brilliancy was manifold. It acted on dreams, it acted on lunacy, it acted on nervous people, it had marvelous physical influences connected with life. Mademoiselle related that her cousin, who was mate of a merchant ship, having taken a nap on deck on such a night, lying on his back, with his face full in the light on the moon, had wakened, after a dream of an old woman clawing him by the cheek, with his features horribly drawn to one side; and his countenance had never quite recovered its equilibrium.&#013;&#013;&quot;The moon, this night,&quot; she said, &quot;is full of idyllic and magnetic influence--and see, when you look behind you at the front of the schloss how all its windows flash and twinkle with that silvery splendor, as if unseen hands had lighted up the rooms to receive fairy guests.&quot;&#013;&#013;There are indolent styles of the spirits in which, indisposed to talk ourselves, the talk of others is pleasant to our listless ears; and I gazed on, pleased with the tinkle of the ladies' conversation.&#013;&#013;&quot;I have got into one of my moping moods tonight,&quot; said my father, after a silence, and quoting Shakespeare, whom, by way of keeping up our English, he used to read aloud, he said:&#013;&#013;&quot;'In truth I know not why I am so sad.&#013;It wearies me: you say it wearies you;&#013;But how I got it--came by it.'&#013;&quot;I forget the rest. But I feel as if some great misfortune were hanging over us. I suppose the poor General's afflicted letter has had something to do with it.&quot;&#013;&#013;At this moment the unwonted sound of carriage wheels and many hoofs upon the road, arrested our attention.&#013;&#013;They seemed to be approaching from the high ground overlooking the bridge, and very soon the equipage emerged from that point. Two horsemen first crossed the bridge, then came a carriage drawn by four horses, and two men rode behind.&#013;&#013;It seemed to be the traveling carriage of a person of rank; and we were all immediately absorbed in watching that very unusual spectacle. It became, in a few moments, greatly more interesting, for just as the carriage had passed the summit of the steep bridge, one of the leaders, taking fright, communicated his panic to the rest, and after a plunge or two, the whole team broke into a wild gallop together, and dashing between the horsemen who rode in front, came thundering along the road towards us with the speed of a hurricane.&#013;&#013;The excitement of the scene was made more painful by the clear, long-drawn screams of a female voice from the carriage window.&#013;&#013;We all advanced in curiosity and horror; me rather in silence, the rest with various ejaculations of terror.&#013;&#013;Our suspense did not last long. Just before you reach the castle drawbridge, on the route they were coming, there stands by the roadside a magnificent lime tree, on the other stands an ancient stone cross, at sight of which the horses, now going at a pace that was perfectly frightful, swerved so as to bring the wheel over the projecting roots of the tree.&#013;&#013;I knew what was coming. I covered my eyes, unable to see it out, and turned my head away; at the same moment I heard a cry from my lady friends, who had gone on a little.&#013;&#013;Curiosity opened my eyes, and I saw a scene of utter confusion. Two of the horses were on the ground, the carriage lay upon its side with two wheels in the air; the men were busy removing the traces, and a lady with a commanding air and figure had got out, and stood with clasped hands, raising the handkerchief that was in them every now and then to her eyes.&#013;&#013;Through the carriage door was now lifted a young lady, who appeared to be lifeless. My dear old father was already beside the elder lady, with his hat in his hand, evidently tendering his aid and the resources of his schloss. The lady did not appear to hear him, or to have eyes for anything but the slender girl who was being placed against the slope of the bank.&#013;&#013;I approached; the young lady was apparently stunned, but she was certainly not dead. My father, who piqued himself on being something of a physician, had just had his fingers on her wrist and assured the lady, who declared herself her mother, that her pulse, though faint and irregular, was undoubtedly still distinguishable. The lady clasped her hands and looked upward, as if in a momentary transport of gratitude; but immediately she broke out again in that theatrical way which is, I believe, natural to some people.&#013;&#013;She was what is called a fine looking woman for her time of life, and must have been handsome; she was tall, but not thin, and dressed in black velvet, and looked rather pale, but with a proud and commanding countenance, though now agitated strangely.&#013;&#013;&quot;Who was ever being so born to calamity?&quot; I heard her say, with clasped hands, as I came up. &quot;Here am I, on a journey of life and death, in prosecuting which to lose an hour is possibly to lose all. My child will not have recovered sufficiently to resume her route for who can say how long. I must leave her: I cannot, dare not, delay. How far on, sir, can you tell, is the nearest village? I must leave her there; and shall not see my darling, or even hear of her till my return, three months hence.&quot;&#013;&#013;I plucked my father by the coat, and whispered earnestly in his ear: &quot;Oh! papa, pray ask her to let her stay with us--it would be so delightful. Do, pray.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;If Madame will entrust her child to the care of my daughter, and of her good gouvernante, Madame Perrodon, and permit her to remain as our guest, under my charge, until her return, it will confer a distinction and an obligation upon us, and we shall treat her with all the care and devotion which so sacred a trust deserves.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I cannot do that, sir, it would be to task your kindness and chivalry too cruelly,&quot; said the lady, distractedly.&#013;&#013;&quot;It would, on the contrary, be to confer on us a very great kindness at the moment when we most need it. My daughter has just been disappointed by a cruel misfortune, in a visit from which she had long anticipated a great deal of happiness. If you confide this young lady to our care it will be her best consolation. The nearest village on your route is distant, and affords no such inn as you could think of placing your daughter at; you cannot allow her to continue her journey for any considerable distance without danger. If, as you say, you cannot suspend your journey, you must part with her tonight, and nowhere could you do so with more honest assurances of care and tenderness than here.&quot;&#013;&#013;There was something in this lady's air and appearance so distinguished and even imposing, and in her manner so engaging, as to impress one, quite apart from the dignity of her equipage, with a conviction that she was a person of consequence.&#013;&#013;By this time the carriage was replaced in its upright position, and the horses, quite tractable, in the traces again.&#013;&#013;The lady threw on her daughter a glance which I fancied was not quite so affectionate as one might have anticipated from the beginning of the scene; then she beckoned slightly to my father, and withdrew two or three steps with him out of hearing; and talked to him with a fixed and stern countenance, not at all like that with which she had hitherto spoken.&#013;&#013;I was filled with wonder that my father did not seem to perceive the change, and also unspeakably curious to learn what it could be that she was speaking, almost in his ear, with so much earnestness and rapidity.&#013;&#013;Two or three minutes at most I think she remained thus employed, then she turned, and a few steps brought her to where her daughter lay, supported by Madame Perrodon. She kneeled beside her for a moment and whispered, as Madame supposed, a little benediction in her ear; then hastily kissing her she stepped into her carriage, the door was closed, the footmen in stately liveries jumped up behind, the outriders spurred on, the postilions cracked their whips, the horses plunged and broke suddenly into a furious canter that threatened soon again to become a gallop, and the carriage whirled away, followed at the same rapid pace by the two horsemen in the rear.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;III&#013;&#013;We Compare Notes&#013;&#013;We followed the cortege with our eyes until it was swiftly lost to sight in the misty wood; and the very sound of the hoofs and the wheels died away in the silent night air.&#013;&#013;Nothing remained to assure us that the adventure had not been an illusion of a moment but the young lady, who just at that moment opened her eyes. I could not see, for her face was turned from me, but she raised her head, evidently looking about her, and I heard a very sweet voice ask complainingly, &quot;Where is mamma?&quot;&#013;&#013;Our good Madame Perrodon answered tenderly, and added some comfortable assurances.&#013;&#013;I then heard her ask:&#013;&#013;&quot;Where am I? What is this place?&quot; and after that she said, &quot;I don't see the carriage; and Matska, where is she?&quot;&#013;&#013;Madame answered all her questions in so far as she understood them; and gradually the young lady remembered how the misadventure came about, and was glad to hear that no one in, or in attendance on, the carriage was hurt; and on learning that her mamma had left her here, till her return in about three months, she wept.&#013;&#013;I was going to add my consolations to those of Madame Perrodon when Mademoiselle De Lafontaine placed her hand upon my arm, saying:&#013;&#013;&quot;Don't approach, one at a time is as much as she can at present converse with; a very little excitement would possibly overpower her now.&quot;&#013;&#013;As soon as she is comfortably in bed, I thought, I will run up to her room and see her.&#013;&#013;My father in the meantime had sent a servant on horseback for the physician, who lived about two leagues away; and a bedroom was being prepared for the young lady's reception.&#013;&#013;The stranger now rose, and leaning on Madame's arm, walked slowly over the drawbridge and into the castle gate.&#013;&#013;In the hall, servants waited to receive her, and she was conducted forthwith to her room. The room we usually sat in as our drawing room is long, having four windows, that looked over the moat and drawbridge, upon the forest scene I have just described.&#013;&#013;It is furnished in old carved oak, with large carved cabinets, and the chairs are cushioned with crimson Utrecht velvet. The walls are covered with tapestry, and surrounded with great gold frames, the figures being as large as life, in ancient and very curious costume, and the subjects represented are hunting, hawking, and generally festive. It is not too stately to be extremely comfortable; and here we had our tea, for with his usual patriotic leanings he insisted that the national beverage should make its appearance regularly with our coffee and chocolate.&#013;&#013;We sat here this night, and with candles lighted, were talking over the adventure of the evening.&#013;&#013;Madame Perrodon and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine were both of our party. The young stranger had hardly lain down in her bed when she sank into a deep sleep; and those ladies had left her in the care of a servant.&#013;&#013;&quot;How do you like our guest?&quot; I asked, as soon as Madame entered. &quot;Tell me all about her?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I like her extremely,&quot; answered Madame, &quot;she is, I almost think, the prettiest creature I ever saw; about your age, and so gentle and nice.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;She is absolutely beautiful,&quot; threw in Mademoiselle, who had peeped for a moment into the stranger's room.&#013;&#013;&quot;And such a sweet voice!&quot; added Madame Perrodon.&#013;&#013;&quot;Did you remark a woman in the carriage, after it was set up again, who did not get out,&quot; inquired Mademoiselle, &quot;but only looked from the window?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;No, we had not seen her.&quot;&#013;&#013;Then she described a hideous black woman, with a sort of colored turban on her head, and who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury.&#013;&#013;&quot;Did you remark what an ill-looking pack of men the servants were?&quot; asked Madame.&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes,&quot; said my father, who had just come in, &quot;ugly, hang-dog looking fellows as ever I beheld in my life. I hope they mayn't rob the poor lady in the forest. They are clever rogues, however; they got everything to rights in a minute.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I dare say they are worn out with too long traveling,&quot; said Madame.&#013;&#013;&quot;Besides looking wicked, their faces were so strangely lean, and dark, and sullen. I am very curious, I own; but I dare say the young lady will tell you all about it tomorrow, if she is sufficiently recovered.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I don't think she will,&quot; said my father, with a mysterious smile, and a little nod of his head, as if he knew more about it than he cared to tell us.&#013;&#013;This made us all the more inquisitive as to what had passed between him and the lady in the black velvet, in the brief but earnest interview that had immediately preceded her departure.&#013;&#013;We were scarcely alone, when I entreated him to tell me. He did not need much pressing.&#013;&#013;&quot;There is no particular reason why I should not tell you. She expressed a reluctance to trouble us with the care of her daughter, saying she was in delicate health, and nervous, but not subject to any kind of seizure--she volunteered that--nor to any illusion; being, in fact, perfectly sane.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;How very odd to say all that!&quot; I interpolated. &quot;It was so unnecessary.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;At all events it was said,&quot; he laughed, &quot;and as you wish to know all that passed, which was indeed very little, I tell you. She then said, 'I am making a long journey of vital importance--she emphasized the word--rapid and secret; I shall return for my child in three months; in the meantime, she will be silent as to who we are, whence we come, and whither we are traveling.' That is all she said. She spoke very pure French. When she said the word 'secret,' she paused for a few seconds, looking sternly, her eyes fixed on mine. I fancy she makes a great point of that. You saw how quickly she was gone. I hope I have not done a very foolish thing, in taking charge of the young lady.&quot;&#013;&#013;For my part, I was delighted. I was longing to see and talk to her; and only waiting till the doctor should give me leave. You, who live in towns, can have no idea how great an event the introduction of a new friend is, in such a solitude as surrounded us.&#013;&#013;The doctor did not arrive till nearly one o'clock; but I could no more have gone to my bed and slept, than I could have overtaken, on foot, the carriage in which the princess in black velvet had driven away.&#013;&#013;When the physician came down to the drawing room, it was to report very favorably upon his patient. She was now sitting up, her pulse quite regular, apparently perfectly well. She had sustained no injury, and the little shock to her nerves had passed away quite harmlessly. There could be no harm certainly in my seeing her, if we both wished it; and, with this permission I sent, forthwith, to know whether she would allow me to visit her for a few minutes in her room.&#013;&#013;The servant returned immediately to say that she desired nothing more.&#013;&#013;You may be sure I was not long in availing myself of this permission.&#013;&#013;Our visitor lay in one of the handsomest rooms in the schloss. It was, perhaps, a little stately. There was a somber piece of tapestry opposite the foot of the bed, representing Cleopatra with the asps to her bosom; and other solemn classic scenes were displayed, a little faded, upon the other walls. But there was gold carving, and rich and varied color enough in the other decorations of the room, to more than redeem the gloom of the old tapestry.&#013;&#013;There were candles at the bedside. She was sitting up; her slender pretty figure enveloped in the soft silk dressing gown, embroidered with flowers, and lined with thick quilted silk, which her mother had thrown over her feet as she lay upon the ground.&#013;&#013;What was it that, as I reached the bedside and had just begun my little greeting, struck me dumb in a moment, and made me recoil a step or two from before her? I will tell you.&#013;&#013;I saw the very face which had visited me in my childhood at night, which remained so fixed in my memory, and on which I had for so many years so often ruminated with horror, when no one suspected of what I was thinking.&#013;&#013;It was pretty, even beautiful; and when I first beheld it, wore the same melancholy expression.&#013;&#013;But this almost instantly lighted into a strange fixed smile of recognition.&#013;&#013;There was a silence of fully a minute, and then at length she spoke; I could not.&#013;&#013;&quot;How wonderful!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Twelve years ago, I saw your face in a dream, and it has haunted me ever since.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Wonderful indeed!&quot; I repeated, overcoming with an effort the horror that had for a time suspended my utterances. &quot;Twelve years ago, in vision or reality, I certainly saw you. I could not forget your face. It has remained before my eyes ever since.&quot;&#013;&#013;Her smile had softened. Whatever I had fancied strange in it, was gone, and it and her dimpling cheeks were now delightfully pretty and intelligent.&#013;&#013;I felt reassured, and continued more in the vein which hospitality indicated, to bid her welcome, and to tell her how much pleasure her accidental arrival had given us all, and especially what a happiness it was to me.&#013;&#013;I took her hand as I spoke. I was a little shy, as lonely people are, but the situation made me eloquent, and even bold. She pressed my hand, she laid hers upon it, and her eyes glowed, as, looking hastily into mine, she smiled again, and blushed.&#013;&#013;She answered my welcome very prettily. I sat down beside her, still wondering; and she said:&#013;&#013;&quot;I must tell you my vision about you; it is so very strange that you and I should have had, each of the other so vivid a dream, that each should have seen, I you and you me, looking as we do now, when of course we both were mere children. I was a child, about six years old, and I awoke from a confused and troubled dream, and found myself in a room, unlike my nursery, wainscoted clumsily in some dark wood, and with cupboards and bedsteads, and chairs, and benches placed about it. The beds were, I thought, all empty, and the room itself without anyone but myself in it; and I, after looking about me for some time, and admiring especially an iron candlestick with two branches, which I should certainly know again, crept under one of the beds to reach the window; but as I got from under the bed, I heard someone crying; and looking up, while I was still upon my knees, I saw you--most assuredly you--as I see you now; a beautiful young lady, with golden hair and large blue eyes, and lips--your lips--you as you are here.&#013;&#013;&quot;Your looks won me; I climbed on the bed and put my arms about you, and I think we both fell asleep. I was aroused by a scream; you were sitting up screaming. I was frightened, and slipped down upon the ground, and, it seemed to me, lost consciousness for a moment; and when I came to myself, I was again in my nursery at home. Your face I have never forgotten since. I could not be misled by mere resemblance. You are the lady whom I saw then.&quot;&#013;&#013;It was now my turn to relate my corresponding vision, which I did, to the undisguised wonder of my new acquaintance.&#013;&#013;&quot;I don't know which should be most afraid of the other,&quot; she said, again smiling--&quot;If you were less pretty I think I should be very much afraid of you, but being as you are, and you and I both so young, I feel only that I have made your acquaintance twelve years ago, and have already a right to your intimacy; at all events it does seem as if we were destined, from our earliest childhood, to be friends. I wonder whether you feel as strangely drawn towards me as I do to you; I have never had a friend--shall I find one now?&quot; She sighed, and her fine dark eyes gazed passionately on me.&#013;&#013;Now the truth is, I felt rather unaccountably towards the beautiful stranger. I did feel, as she said, &quot;drawn towards her,&quot; but there was also something of repulsion. In this ambiguous feeling, however, the sense of attraction immensely prevailed. She interested and won me; she was so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.&#013;&#013;I perceived now something of languor and exhaustion stealing over her, and hastened to bid her good night.&#013;&#013;&quot;The doctor thinks,&quot; I added, &quot;that you ought to have a maid to sit up with you tonight; one of ours is waiting, and you will find her a very useful and quiet creature.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;How kind of you, but I could not sleep, I never could with an attendant in the room. I shan't require any assistance--and, shall I confess my weakness, I am haunted with a terror of robbers. Our house was robbed once, and two servants murdered, so I always lock my door. It has become a habit--and you look so kind I know you will forgive me. I see there is a key in the lock.&quot;&#013;&#013;She held me close in her pretty arms for a moment and whispered in my ear, &quot;Good night, darling, it is very hard to part with you, but good night; tomorrow, but not early, I shall see you again.&quot;&#013;&#013;She sank back on the pillow with a sigh, and her fine eyes followed me with a fond and melancholy gaze, and she murmured again &quot;Good night, dear friend.&quot;&#013;&#013;Young people like, and even love, on impulse. I was flattered by the evident, though as yet undeserved, fondness she showed me. I liked the confidence with which she at once received me. She was determined that we should be very near friends.&#013;&#013;Next day came and we met again. I was delighted with my companion; that is to say, in many respects.&#013;&#013;Her looks lost nothing in daylight--she was certainly the most beautiful creature I had ever seen, and the unpleasant remembrance of the face presented in my early dream, had lost the effect of the first unexpected recognition.&#013;&#013;She confessed that she had experienced a similar shock on seeing me, and precisely the same faint antipathy that had mingled with my admiration of her. We now laughed together over our momentary horrors.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;IV&#013;&#013;Her Habits--A Saunter&#013;&#013;I told you that I was charmed with her in most particulars.&#013;&#013;There were some that did not please me so well.&#013;&#013;She was above the middle height of women. I shall begin by describing her.&#013;&#013;She was slender, and wonderfully graceful. Except that her movements were languid--very languid--indeed, there was nothing in her appearance to indicate an invalid. Her complexion was rich and brilliant; her features were small and beautifully formed; her eyes large, dark, and lustrous; her hair was quite wonderful, I never saw hair so magnificently thick and long when it was down about her shoulders; I have often placed my hands under it, and laughed with wonder at its weight. It was exquisitely fine and soft, and in color a rich very dark brown, with something of gold. I loved to let it down, tumbling with its own weight, as, in her room, she lay back in her chair talking in her sweet low voice, I used to fold and braid it, and spread it out and play with it. Heavens! If I had but known all!&#013;&#013;I said there were particulars which did not please me. I have told you that her confidence won me the first night I saw her; but I found that she exercised with respect to herself, her mother, her history, everything in fact connected with her life, plans, and people, an ever wakeful reserve. I dare say I was unreasonable, perhaps I was wrong; I dare say I ought to have respected the solemn injunction laid upon my father by the stately lady in black velvet. But curiosity is a restless and unscrupulous passion, and no one girl can endure, with patience, that hers should be baffled by another. What harm could it do anyone to tell me what I so ardently desired to know? Had she no trust in my good sense or honor? Why would she not believe me when I assured her, so solemnly, that I would not divulge one syllable of what she told me to any mortal breathing.&#013;&#013;There was a coldness, it seemed to me, beyond her years, in her smiling melancholy persistent refusal to afford me the least ray of light.&#013;&#013;I cannot say we quarreled upon this point, for she would not quarrel upon any. It was, of course, very unfair of me to press her, very ill-bred, but I really could not help it; and I might just as well have let it alone.&#013;&#013;What she did tell me amounted, in my unconscionable estimation--to nothing.&#013;&#013;It was all summed up in three very vague disclosures:&#013;&#013;First--Her name was Carmilla.&#013;&#013;Second--Her family was very ancient and noble.&#013;&#013;Third--Her home lay in the direction of the west.&#013;&#013;She would not tell me the name of her family, nor their armorial bearings, nor the name of their estate, nor even that of the country they lived in.&#013;&#013;You are not to suppose that I worried her incessantly on these subjects. I watched opportunity, and rather insinuated than urged my inquiries. Once or twice, indeed, I did attack her more directly. But no matter what my tactics, utter failure was invariably the result. Reproaches and caresses were all lost upon her. But I must add this, that her evasion was conducted with so pretty a melancholy and deprecation, with so many, and even passionate declarations of her liking for me, and trust in my honor, and with so many promises that I should at last know all, that I could not find it in my heart long to be offended with her.&#013;&#013;She used to place her pretty arms about my neck, draw me to her, and laying her cheek to mine, murmur with her lips near my ear, &quot;Dearest, your little heart is wounded; think me not cruel because I obey the irresistible law of my strength and weakness; if your dear heart is wounded, my wild heart bleeds with yours. In the rapture of my enormous humiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die--die, sweetly die--into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you, you, in your turn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of that cruelty, which yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more of me and mine, but trust me with all your loving spirit.&quot;&#013;&#013;And when she had spoken such a rhapsody, she would press me more closely in her trembling embrace, and her lips in soft kisses gently glow upon my cheek.&#013;&#013;Her agitations and her language were unintelligible to me.&#013;&#013;From these foolish embraces, which were not of very frequent occurrence, I must allow, I used to wish to extricate myself; but my energies seemed to fail me. Her murmured words sounded like a lullaby in my ear, and soothed my resistance into a trance, from which I only seemed to recover myself when she withdrew her arms.&#013;&#013;In these mysterious moods I did not like her. I experienced a strange tumultuous excitement that was pleasurable, ever and anon, mingled with a vague sense of fear and disgust. I had no distinct thoughts about her while such scenes lasted, but I was conscious of a love growing into adoration, and also of abhorrence. This I know is paradox, but I can make no other attempt to explain the feeling.&#013;&#013;I now write, after an interval of more than ten years, with a trembling hand, with a confused and horrible recollection of certain occurrences and situations, in the ordeal through which I was unconsciously passing; though with a vivid and very sharp remembrance of the main current of my story.&#013;&#013;But, I suspect, in all lives there are certain emotional scenes, those in which our passions have been most wildly and terribly roused, that are of all others the most vaguely and dimly remembered.&#013;&#013;Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, &quot;You are mine, you shall be mine, you and I are one for ever.&quot; Then she had thrown herself back in her chair, with her small hands over her eyes, leaving me trembling.&#013;&#013;&quot;Are we related,&quot; I used to ask; &quot;what can you mean by all this? I remind you perhaps of someone whom you love; but you must not, I hate it; I don't know you--I don't know myself when you look so and talk so.&quot;&#013;&#013;She used to sigh at my vehemence, then turn away and drop my hand.&#013;&#013;Respecting these very extraordinary manifestations I strove in vain to form any satisfactory theory--I could not refer them to affectation or trick. It was unmistakably the momentary breaking out of suppressed instinct and emotion. Was she, notwithstanding her mother's volunteered denial, subject to brief visitations of insanity; or was there here a disguise and a romance? I had read in old storybooks of such things. What if a boyish lover had found his way into the house, and sought to prosecute his suit in masquerade, with the assistance of a clever old adventuress. But there were many things against this hypothesis, highly interesting as it was to my vanity.&#013;&#013;I could boast of no little attentions such as masculine gallantry delights to offer. Between these passionate moments there were long intervals of commonplace, of gaiety, of brooding melancholy, during which, except that I detected her eyes so full of melancholy fire, following me, at times I might have been as nothing to her. Except in these brief periods of mysterious excitement her ways were girlish; and there was always a languor about her, quite incompatible with a masculine system in a state of health.&#013;&#013;In some respects her habits were odd. Perhaps not so singular in the opinion of a town lady like you, as they appeared to us rustic people. She used to come down very late, generally not till one o'clock, she would then take a cup of chocolate, but eat nothing; we then went out for a walk, which was a mere saunter, and she seemed, almost immediately, exhausted, and either returned to the schloss or sat on one of the benches that were placed, here and there, among the trees. This was a bodily languor in which her mind did not sympathize. She was always an animated talker, and very intelligent.&#013;&#013;She sometimes alluded for a moment to her own home, or mentioned an adventure or situation, or an early recollection, which indicated a people of strange manners, and described customs of which we knew nothing. I gathered from these chance hints that her native country was much more remote than I had at first fancied.&#013;&#013;As we sat thus one afternoon under the trees a funeral passed us by. It was that of a pretty young girl, whom I had often seen, the daughter of one of the rangers of the forest. The poor man was walking behind the coffin of his darling; she was his only child, and he looked quite heartbroken.&#013;&#013;Peasants walking two-and-two came behind, they were singing a funeral hymn.&#013;&#013;I rose to mark my respect as they passed, and joined in the hymn they were very sweetly singing.&#013;&#013;My companion shook me a little roughly, and I turned surprised.&#013;&#013;She said brusquely, &quot;Don't you perceive how discordant that is?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I think it very sweet, on the contrary,&quot; I answered, vexed at the interruption, and very uncomfortable, lest the people who composed the little procession should observe and resent what was passing.&#013;&#013;I resumed, therefore, instantly, and was again interrupted. &quot;You pierce my ears,&quot; said Carmilla, almost angrily, and stopping her ears with her tiny fingers. &quot;Besides, how can you tell that your religion and mine are the same; your forms wound me, and I hate funerals. What a fuss! Why you must die--everyone must die; and all are happier when they do. Come home.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;My father has gone on with the clergyman to the churchyard. I thought you knew she was to be buried today.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;She? I don't trouble my head about peasants. I don't know who she is,&quot; answered Carmilla, with a flash from her fine eyes.&#013;&#013;&quot;She is the poor girl who fancied she saw a ghost a fortnight ago, and has been dying ever since, till yesterday, when she expired.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Tell me nothing about ghosts. I shan't sleep tonight if you do.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I hope there is no plague or fever coming; all this looks very like it,&quot; I continued. &quot;The swineherd's young wife died only a week ago, and she thought something seized her by the throat as she lay in her bed, and nearly strangled her. Papa says such horrible fancies do accompany some forms of fever. She was quite well the day before. She sank afterwards, and died before a week.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Well, her funeral is over, I hope, and her hymn sung; and our ears shan't be tortured with that discord and jargon. It has made me nervous. Sit down here, beside me; sit close; hold my hand; press it hard-hard-harder.&quot;&#013;&#013;We had moved a little back, and had come to another seat.&#013;&#013;She sat down. Her face underwent a change that alarmed and even terrified me for a moment. It darkened, and became horribly livid; her teeth and hands were clenched, and she frowned and compressed her lips, while she stared down upon the ground at her feet, and trembled all over with a continued shudder as irrepressible as ague. All her energies seemed strained to suppress a fit, with which she was then breathlessly tugging; and at length a low convulsive cry of suffering broke from her, and gradually the hysteria subsided. &quot;There! That comes of strangling people with hymns!&quot; she said at last. &quot;Hold me, hold me still. It is passing away.&quot;&#013;&#013;And so gradually it did; and perhaps to dissipate the somber impression which the spectacle had left upon me, she became unusually animated and chatty; and so we got home.&#013;&#013;This was the first time I had seen her exhibit any definable symptoms of that delicacy of health which her mother had spoken of. It was the first time, also, I had seen her exhibit anything like temper.&#013;&#013;Both passed away like a summer cloud; and never but once afterwards did I witness on her part a momentary sign of anger. I will tell you how it happened.&#013;&#013;She and I were looking out of one of the long drawing room windows, when there entered the courtyard, over the drawbridge, a figure of a wanderer whom I knew very well. He used to visit the schloss generally twice a year.&#013;&#013;It was the figure of a hunchback, with the sharp lean features that generally accompany deformity. He wore a pointed black beard, and he was smiling from ear to ear, showing his white fangs. He was dressed in buff, black, and scarlet, and crossed with more straps and belts than I could count, from which hung all manner of things. Behind, he carried a magic lantern, and two boxes, which I well knew, in one of which was a salamander, and in the other a mandrake. These monsters used to make my father laugh. They were compounded of parts of monkeys, parrots, squirrels, fish, and hedgehogs, dried and stitched together with great neatness and startling effect. He had a fiddle, a box of conjuring apparatus, a pair of foils and masks attached to his belt, several other mysterious cases dangling about him, and a black staff with copper ferrules in his hand. His companion was a rough spare dog, that followed at his heels, but stopped short, suspiciously at the drawbridge, and in a little while began to howl dismally.&#013;&#013;In the meantime, the mountebank, standing in the midst of the courtyard, raised his grotesque hat, and made us a very ceremonious bow, paying his compliments very volubly in execrable French, and German not much better.&#013;&#013;Then, disengaging his fiddle, he began to scrape a lively air to which he sang with a merry discord, dancing with ludicrous airs and activity, that made me laugh, in spite of the dog's howling.&#013;&#013;Then he advanced to the window with many smiles and salutations, and his hat in his left hand, his fiddle under his arm, and with a fluency that never took breath, he gabbled a long advertisement of all his accomplishments, and the resources of the various arts which he placed at our service, and the curiosities and entertainments which it was in his power, at our bidding, to display.&#013;&#013;&quot;Will your ladyships be pleased to buy an amulet against the oupire, which is going like the wolf, I hear, through these woods,&quot; he said dropping his hat on the pavement. &quot;They are dying of it right and left and here is a charm that never fails; only pinned to the pillow, and you may laugh in his face.&quot;&#013;&#013;These charms consisted of oblong slips of vellum, with cabalistic ciphers and diagrams upon them.&#013;&#013;Carmilla instantly purchased one, and so did I.&#013;&#013;He was looking up, and we were smiling down upon him, amused; at least, I can answer for myself. His piercing black eye, as he looked up in our faces, seemed to detect something that fixed for a moment his curiosity,&#013;&#013;In an instant he unrolled a leather case, full of all manner of odd little steel instruments.&#013;&#013;&quot;See here, my lady,&quot; he said, displaying it, and addressing me, &quot;I profess, among other things less useful, the art of dentistry. Plague take the dog!&quot; he interpolated. &quot;Silence, beast! He howls so that your ladyships can scarcely hear a word. Your noble friend, the young lady at your right, has the sharpest tooth,--long, thin, pointed, like an awl, like a needle; ha, ha! With my sharp and long sight, as I look up, I have seen it distinctly; now if it happens to hurt the young lady, and I think it must, here am I, here are my file, my punch, my nippers; I will make it round and blunt, if her ladyship pleases; no longer the tooth of a fish, but of a beautiful young lady as she is. Hey? Is the young lady displeased? Have I been too bold? Have I offended her?&quot;&#013;&#013;The young lady, indeed, looked very angry as she drew back from the window.&#013;&#013;&quot;How dares that mountebank insult us so? Where is your father? I shall demand redress from him. My father would have had the wretch tied up to the pump, and flogged with a cart whip, and burnt to the bones with the cattle brand!&quot;&#013;&#013;She retired from the window a step or two, and sat down, and had hardly lost sight of the offender, when her wrath subsided as suddenly as it had risen, and she gradually recovered her usual tone, and seemed to forget the little hunchback and his follies.&#013;&#013;My father was out of spirits that evening. On coming in he told us that there had been another case very similar to the two fatal ones which had lately occurred. The sister of a young peasant on his estate, only a mile away, was very ill, had been, as she described it, attacked very nearly in the same way, and was now slowly but steadily sinking.&#013;&#013;&quot;All this,&quot; said my father, &quot;is strictly referable to natural causes. These poor people infect one another with their superstitions, and so repeat in imagination the images of terror that have infested their neighbors.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But that very circumstance frightens one horribly,&quot; said Carmilla.&#013;&#013;&quot;How so?&quot; inquired my father.&#013;&#013;&quot;I am so afraid of fancying I see such things; I think it would be as bad as reality.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;We are in God's hands: nothing can happen without his permission, and all will end well for those who love him. He is our faithful creator; He has made us all, and will take care of us.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Creator! Nature!&quot; said the young lady in answer to my gentle father. &quot;And this disease that invades the country is natural. Nature. All things proceed from Nature--don't they? All things in the heaven, in the earth, and under the earth, act and live as Nature ordains? I think so.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;The doctor said he would come here today,&quot; said my father, after a silence. &quot;I want to know what he thinks about it, and what he thinks we had better do.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Doctors never did me any good,&quot; said Carmilla.&#013;&#013;&quot;Then you have been ill?&quot; I asked.&#013;&#013;&quot;More ill than ever you were,&quot; she answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;Long ago?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes, a long time. I suffered from this very illness; but I forget all but my pain and weakness, and they were not so bad as are suffered in other diseases.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You were very young then?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I dare say, let us talk no more of it. You would not wound a friend?&quot;&#013;&#013;She looked languidly in my eyes, and passed her arm round my waist lovingly, and led me out of the room. My father was busy over some papers near the window.&#013;&#013;&quot;Why does your papa like to frighten us?&quot; said the pretty girl with a sigh and a little shudder.&#013;&#013;&quot;He doesn't, dear Carmilla, it is the very furthest thing from his mind.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Are you afraid, dearest?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I should be very much if I fancied there was any real danger of my being attacked as those poor people were.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You are afraid to die?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes, every one is.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But to die as lovers may--to die together, so that they may live together.&#013;&#013;Girls are caterpillars while they live in the world, to be finally butterflies when the summer comes; but in the meantime there are grubs and larvae, don't you see--each with their peculiar propensities, necessities and structure. So says Monsieur Buffon, in his big book, in the next room.&quot;&#013;&#013;Later in the day the doctor came, and was closeted with papa for some time.&#013;&#013;He was a skilful man, of sixty and upwards, he wore powder, and shaved his pale face as smooth as a pumpkin. He and papa emerged from the room together, and I heard papa laugh, and say as they came out:&#013;&#013;&quot;Well, I do wonder at a wise man like you. What do you say to hippogriffs and dragons?&quot;&#013;&#013;The doctor was smiling, and made answer, shaking his head--&#013;&#013;&quot;Nevertheless life and death are mysterious states, and we know little of the resources of either.&quot;&#013;&#013;And so they walked on, and I heard no more. I did not then know what the doctor had been broaching, but I think I guess it now.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;V&#013;&#013;A Wonderful Likeness&#013;&#013;This evening there arrived from Gratz the grave, dark-faced son of the picture cleaner, with a horse and cart laden with two large packing cases, having many pictures in each. It was a journey of ten leagues, and whenever a messenger arrived at the schloss from our little capital of Gratz, we used to crowd about him in the hall, to hear the news.&#013;&#013;This arrival created in our secluded quarters quite a sensation. The cases remained in the hall, and the messenger was taken charge of by the servants till he had eaten his supper. Then with assistants, and armed with hammer, ripping chisel, and turnscrew, he met us in the hall, where we had assembled to witness the unpacking of the cases.&#013;&#013;Carmilla sat looking listlessly on, while one after the other the old pictures, nearly all portraits, which had undergone the process of renovation, were brought to light. My mother was of an old Hungarian family, and most of these pictures, which were about to be restored to their places, had come to us through her.&#013;&#013;My father had a list in his hand, from which he read, as the artist rummaged out the corresponding numbers. I don't know that the pictures were very good, but they were, undoubtedly, very old, and some of them very curious also. They had, for the most part, the merit of being now seen by me, I may say, for the first time; for the smoke and dust of time had all but obliterated them.&#013;&#013;&quot;There is a picture that I have not seen yet,&quot; said my father. &quot;In one corner, at the top of it, is the name, as well as I could read, 'Marcia Karnstein,' and the date '1698'; and I am curious to see how it has turned out.&quot;&#013;&#013;I remembered it; it was a small picture, about a foot and a half high, and nearly square, without a frame; but it was so blackened by age that I could not make it out.&#013;&#013;The artist now produced it, with evident pride. It was quite beautiful; it was startling; it seemed to live. It was the effigy of Carmilla!&#013;&#013;&quot;Carmilla, dear, here is an absolute miracle. Here you are, living, smiling, ready to speak, in this picture. Isn't it beautiful, Papa? And see, even the little mole on her throat.&quot;&#013;&#013;My father laughed, and said &quot;Certainly it is a wonderful likeness,&quot; but he looked away, and to my surprise seemed but little struck by it, and went on talking to the picture cleaner, who was also something of an artist, and discoursed with intelligence about the portraits or other works, which his art had just brought into light and color, while I was more and more lost in wonder the more I looked at the picture.&#013;&#013;&quot;Will you let me hang this picture in my room, papa?&quot; I asked.&#013;&#013;&quot;Certainly, dear,&quot; said he, smiling, &quot;I'm very glad you think it so like.&#013;&#013;It must be prettier even than I thought it, if it is.&quot;&#013;&#013;The young lady did not acknowledge this pretty speech, did not seem to hear it. She was leaning back in her seat, her fine eyes under their long lashes gazing on me in contemplation, and she smiled in a kind of rapture.&#013;&#013;&quot;And now you can read quite plainly the name that is written in the corner.&#013;&#013;It is not Marcia; it looks as if it was done in gold. The name is Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, and this is a little coronet over and underneath A.D.&#013;&#013;1698. I am descended from the Karnsteins; that is, mamma was.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Ah!&quot; said the lady, languidly, &quot;so am I, I think, a very long descent, very ancient. Are there any Karnsteins living now?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;None who bear the name, I believe. The family were ruined, I believe, in some civil wars, long ago, but the ruins of the castle are only about three miles away.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;How interesting!&quot; she said, languidly. &quot;But see what beautiful moonlight!&quot; She glanced through the hall door, which stood a little open. &quot;Suppose you take a little ramble round the court, and look down at the road and river.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;It is so like the night you came to us,&quot; I said.&#013;&#013;She sighed; smiling.&#013;&#013;She rose, and each with her arm about the other's waist, we walked out upon the pavement.&#013;&#013;In silence, slowly we walked down to the drawbridge, where the beautiful landscape opened before us.&#013;&#013;&quot;And so you were thinking of the night I came here?&quot; she almost whispered.&#013;&#013;&quot;Are you glad I came?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Delighted, dear Carmilla,&quot; I answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;And you asked for the picture you think like me, to hang in your room,&quot; she murmured with a sigh, as she drew her arm closer about my waist, and let her pretty head sink upon my shoulder. &quot;How romantic you are, Carmilla,&quot; I said. &quot;Whenever you tell me your story, it will be made up chiefly of some one great romance.&quot;&#013;&#013;She kissed me silently.&#013;&#013;&quot;I am sure, Carmilla, you have been in love; that there is, at this moment, an affair of the heart going on.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I have been in love with no one, and never shall,&quot; she whispered, &quot;unless it should be with you.&quot;&#013;&#013;How beautiful she looked in the moonlight!&#013;&#013;Shy and strange was the look with which she quickly hid her face in my neck and hair, with tumultuous sighs, that seemed almost to sob, and pressed in mine a hand that trembled.&#013;&#013;Her soft cheek was glowing against mine. &quot;Darling, darling,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I live in you; and you would die for me, I love you so.&quot;&#013;&#013;I started from her.&#013;&#013;She was gazing on me with eyes from which all fire, all meaning had flown, and a face colorless and apathetic.&#013;&#013;&quot;Is there a chill in the air, dear?&quot; she said drowsily. &quot;I almost shiver; have I been dreaming? Let us come in. Come; come; come in.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You look ill, Carmilla; a little faint. You certainly must take some wine,&quot; I said.&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes. I will. I'm better now. I shall be quite well in a few minutes. Yes, do give me a little wine,&quot; answered Carmilla, as we approached the door.&#013;&#013;&quot;Let us look again for a moment; it is the last time, perhaps, I shall see the moonlight with you.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;How do you feel now, dear Carmilla? Are you really better?&quot; I asked.&#013;&#013;I was beginning to take alarm, lest she should have been stricken with the strange epidemic that they said had invaded the country about us.&#013;&#013;&quot;Papa would be grieved beyond measure,&quot; I added, &quot;if he thought you were ever so little ill, without immediately letting us know. We have a very skilful doctor near us, the physician who was with papa today.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I'm sure he is. I know how kind you all are; but, dear child, I am quite well again. There is nothing ever wrong with me, but a little weakness.&#013;&#013;People say I am languid; I am incapable of exertion; I can scarcely walk as far as a child of three years old: and every now and then the little strength I have falters, and I become as you have just seen me. But after all I am very easily set up again; in a moment I am perfectly myself. See how I have recovered.&quot;&#013;&#013;So, indeed, she had; and she and I talked a great deal, and very animated she was; and the remainder of that evening passed without any recurrence of what I called her infatuations. I mean her crazy talk and looks, which embarrassed, and even frightened me.&#013;&#013;But there occurred that night an event which gave my thoughts quite a new turn, and seemed to startle even Carmilla's languid nature into momentary energy.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;VI&#013;&#013;A Very Strange Agony&#013;&#013;When we got into the drawing room, and had sat down to our coffee and chocolate, although Carmilla did not take any, she seemed quite herself again, and Madame, and Mademoiselle De Lafontaine, joined us, and made a little card party, in the course of which papa came in for what he called his &quot;dish of tea.&quot;&#013;&#013;When the game was over he sat down beside Carmilla on the sofa, and asked her, a little anxiously, whether she had heard from her mother since her arrival.&#013;&#013;She answered &quot;No.&quot;&#013;&#013;He then asked whether she knew where a letter would reach her at present.&#013;&#013;&quot;I cannot tell,&quot; she answered ambiguously, &quot;but I have been thinking of leaving you; you have been already too hospitable and too kind to me. I have given you an infinity of trouble, and I should wish to take a carriage tomorrow, and post in pursuit of her; I know where I shall ultimately find her, although I dare not yet tell you.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But you must not dream of any such thing,&quot; exclaimed my father, to my great relief. &quot;We can't afford to lose you so, and I won't consent to your leaving us, except under the care of your mother, who was so good as to consent to your remaining with us till she should herself return. I should be quite happy if I knew that you heard from her: but this evening the accounts of the progress of the mysterious disease that has invaded our neighborhood, grow even more alarming; and my beautiful guest, I do feel the responsibility, unaided by advice from your mother, very much. But I shall do my best; and one thing is certain, that you must not think of leaving us without her distinct direction to that effect. We should suffer too much in parting from you to consent to it easily.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Thank you, sir, a thousand times for your hospitality,&quot; she answered, smiling bashfully. &quot;You have all been too kind to me; I have seldom been so happy in all my life before, as in your beautiful chateau, under your care, and in the society of your dear daughter.&quot;&#013;&#013;So he gallantly, in his old-fashioned way, kissed her hand, smiling and pleased at her little speech.&#013;&#013;I accompanied Carmilla as usual to her room, and sat and chatted with her while she was preparing for bed.&#013;&#013;&quot;Do you think,&quot; I said at length, &quot;that you will ever confide fully in me?&quot;&#013;&#013;She turned round smiling, but made no answer, only continued to smile on me.&#013;&#013;&quot;You won't answer that?&quot; I said. &quot;You can't answer pleasantly; I ought not to have asked you.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You were quite right to ask me that, or anything. You do not know how dear you are to me, or you could not think any confidence too great to look for.&#013;&#013;But I am under vows, no nun half so awfully, and I dare not tell my story yet, even to you. The time is very near when you shall know everything. You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me and still come with me. and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Now, Carmilla, you are going to talk your wild nonsense again,&quot; I said hastily.&#013;&#013;&quot;Not I, silly little fool as I am, and full of whims and fancies; for your sake I'll talk like a sage. Were you ever at a ball?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;No; how you do run on. What is it like? How charming it must be.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I almost forget, it is years ago.&quot;&#013;&#013;I laughed.&#013;&#013;&quot;You are not so old. Your first ball can hardly be forgotten yet.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I remember everything about it--with an effort. I see it all, as divers see what is going on above them, through a medium, dense, rippling, but transparent. There occurred that night what has confused the picture, and made its colours faint. I was all but assassinated in my bed, wounded here,&quot; she touched her breast, &quot;and never was the same since.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Were you near dying?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes, very--a cruel love--strange love, that would have taken my life. Love will have its sacrifices. No sacrifice without blood. Let us go to sleep now; I feel so lazy. How can I get up just now and lock my door?&quot;&#013;&#013;She was lying with her tiny hands buried in her rich wavy hair, under her cheek, her little head upon the pillow, and her glittering eyes followed me wherever I moved, with a kind of shy smile that I could not decipher.&#013;&#013;I bid her good night, and crept from the room with an uncomfortable sensation.&#013;&#013;I often wondered whether our pretty guest ever said her prayers. I certainly had never seen her upon her knees. In the morning she never came down until long after our family prayers were over, and at night she never left the drawing room to attend our brief evening prayers in the hall.&#013;&#013;If it had not been that it had casually come out in one of our careless talks that she had been baptised, I should have doubted her being a Christian. Religion was a subject on which I had never heard her speak a word. If I had known the world better, this particular neglect or antipathy would not have so much surprised me.&#013;&#013;The precautions of nervous people are infectious, and persons of a like temperament are pretty sure, after a time, to imitate them. I had adopted Carmilla's habit of locking her bedroom door, having taken into my head all her whimsical alarms about midnight invaders and prowling assassins. I had also adopted her precaution of making a brief search through her room, to satisfy herself that no lurking assassin or robber was &quot;ensconced.&quot;&#013;&#013;These wise measures taken, I got into my bed and fell asleep. A light was burning in my room. This was an old habit, of very early date, and which nothing could have tempted me to dispense with.&#013;&#013;Thus fortifed I might take my rest in peace. But dreams come through stone walls, light up dark rooms, or darken light ones, and their persons make their exits and their entrances as they please, and laugh at locksmiths.&#013;&#013;I had a dream that night that was the beginning of a very strange agony.&#013;&#013;I cannot call it a nightmare, for I was quite conscious of being asleep.&#013;&#013;But I was equally conscious of being in my room, and lying in bed, precisely as I actually was. I saw, or fancied I saw, the room and its furniture just as I had seen it last, except that it was very dark, and I saw something moving round the foot of the bed, which at first I could not accurately distinguish. But I soon saw that it was a sooty-black animal that resembled a monstrous cat. It appeared to me about four or five feet long for it measured fully the length of the hearthrug as it passed over it; and it continued to-ing and fro-ing with the lithe, sinister restlessness of a beast in a cage. I could not cry out, although as you may suppose, I was terrified. Its pace was growing faster, and the room rapidly darker and darker, and at length so dark that I could no longer see anything of it but its eyes. I felt it spring lightly on the bed. The two broad eyes approached my face, and suddenly I felt a stinging pain as if two large needles darted, an inch or two apart, deep into my breast. I waked with a scream. The room was lighted by the candle that burnt there all through the night, and I saw a female figure standing at the foot of the bed, a little at the right side. It was in a dark loose dress, and its hair was down and covered its shoulders. A block of stone could not have been more still. There was not the slightest stir of respiration. As I stared at it, the figure appeared to have changed its place, and was now nearer the door; then, close to it, the door opened, and it passed out.&#013;&#013;I was now relieved, and able to breathe and move. My first thought was that Carmilla had been playing me a trick, and that I had forgotten to secure my door. I hastened to it, and found it locked as usual on the inside. I was afraid to open it--I was horrified. I sprang into my bed and covered my head up in the bedclothes, and lay there more dead than alive till morning.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;VII&#013;&#013;Descending&#013;&#013;It would be vain my attempting to tell you the horror with which, even now, I recall the occurrence of that night. It was no such transitory terror as a dream leaves behind it. It seemed to deepen by time, and communicated itself to the room and the very furniture that had encompassed the apparition.&#013;&#013;I could not bear next day to be alone for a moment. I should have told papa, but for two opposite reasons. At one time I thought he would laugh at my story, and I could not bear its being treated as a jest; and at another I thought he might fancy that I had been attacked by the mysterious complaint which had invaded our neighborhood. I had myself no misgiving of the kind, and as he had been rather an invalid for some time, I was afraid of alarming him.&#013;&#013;I was comfortable enough with my good-natured companions, Madame Perrodon, and the vivacious Mademoiselle Lafontaine. They both perceived that I was out of spirits and nervous, and at length I told them what lay so heavy at my heart.&#013;&#013;Mademoiselle laughed, but I fancied that Madame Perrodon looked anxious.&#013;&#013;&quot;By-the-by,&quot; said Mademoiselle, laughing, &quot;the long lime tree walk, behind Carmilla's bedroom window, is haunted!&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Nonsense!&quot; exclaimed Madame, who probably thought the theme rather inopportune, &quot;and who tells that story, my dear?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Martin says that he came up twice, when the old yard gate was being repaired, before sunrise, and twice saw the same female figure walking down the lime tree avenue.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;So he well might, as long as there are cows to milk in the river fields,&quot; said Madame.&#013;&#013;&quot;I daresay; but Martin chooses to be frightened, and never did I see fool more frightened.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You must not say a word about it to Carmilla, because she can see down that walk from her room window,&quot; I interposed, &quot;and she is, if possible, a greater coward than I.&quot;&#013;&#013;Carmilla came down rather later than usual that day.&#013;&#013;&quot;I was so frightened last night,&quot; she said, so soon as were together, &quot;and I am sure I should have seen something dreadful if it had not been for that charm I bought from the poor little hunchback whom I called such hard names. I had a dream of something black coming round my bed, and I awoke in a perfect horror, and I really thought, for some seconds, I saw a dark figure near the chimneypiece, but I felt under my pillow for my charm, and the moment my fingers touched it, the figure disappeared, and I felt quite certain, only that I had it by me, that something frightful would have made its appearance, and, perhaps, throttled me, as it did those poor people we heard of.&#013;&#013;&quot;Well, listen to me,&quot; I began, and recounted my adventure, at the recital of which she appeared horrified.&#013;&#013;&quot;And had you the charm near you?&quot; she asked, earnestly.&#013;&#013;&quot;No, I had dropped it into a china vase in the drawing room, but I shall certainly take it with me tonight, as you have so much faith in it.&quot;&#013;&#013;At this distance of time I cannot tell you, or even understand, how I overcame my horror so effectually as to lie alone in my room that night. I remember distinctly that I pinned the charm to my pillow. I fell asleep almost immediately, and slept even more soundly than usual all night.&#013;&#013;Next night I passed as well. My sleep was delightfully deep and dreamless.&#013;&#013;But I wakened with a sense of lassitude and melancholy, which, however, did not exceed a degree that was almost luxurious.&#013;&#013;&quot;Well, I told you so,&quot; said Carmilla, when I described my quiet sleep, &quot;I had such delightful sleep myself last night; I pinned the charm to the breast of my nightdress. It was too far away the night before. I am quite sure it was all fancy, except the dreams. I used to think that evil spirits made dreams, but our doctor told me it is no such thing. Only a fever passing by, or some other malady, as they often do, he said, knocks at the door, and not being able to get in, passes on, with that alarm.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;And what do you think the charm is?&quot; said I.&#013;&#013;&quot;It has been fumigated or immersed in some drug, and is an antidote against the malaria,&quot; she answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;Then it acts only on the body?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Certainly; you don't suppose that evil spirits are frightened by bits of ribbon, or the perfumes of a druggist's shop? No, these complaints, wandering in the air, begin by trying the nerves, and so infect the brain, but before they can seize upon you, the antidote repels them. That I am sure is what the charm has done for us. It is nothing magical, it is simply natural.&#013;&#013;I should have been happier if I could have quite agreed with Carmilla, but I did my best, and the impression was a little losing its force.&#013;&#013;For some nights I slept profoundly; but still every morning I felt the same lassitude, and a languor weighed upon me all day. I felt myself a changed girl. A strange melancholy was stealing over me, a melancholy that I would not have interrupted. Dim thoughts of death began to open, and an idea that I was slowly sinking took gentle, and, somehow, not unwelcome, possession of me. If it was sad, the tone of mind which this induced was also sweet.&#013;&#013;Whatever it might be, my soul acquiesced in it.&#013;&#013;I would not admit that I was ill, I would not consent to tell my papa, or to have the doctor sent for.&#013;&#013;Carmilla became more devoted to me than ever, and her strange paroxysms of languid adoration more frequent. She used to gloat on me with increasing ardor the more my strength and spirits waned. This always shocked me like a momentary glare of insanity.&#013;&#013;Without knowing it, I was now in a pretty advanced stage of the strangest illness under which mortal ever suffered. There was an unaccountable fascination in its earlier symptoms that more than reconciled me to the incapacitating effect of that stage of the malady. This fascination increased for a time, until it reached a certain point, when gradually a sense of the horrible mingled itself with it, deepening, as you shall hear, until it discolored and perverted the whole state of my life.&#013;&#013;The first change I experienced was rather agreeable. It was very near the turning point from which began the descent of Avernus.&#013;&#013;Certain vague and strange sensations visited me in my sleep. The prevailing one was of that pleasant, peculiar cold thrill which we feel in bathing, when we move against the current of a river. This was soon accompanied by dreams that seemed interminable, and were so vague that I could never recollect their scenery and persons, or any one connected portion of their action. But they left an awful impression, and a sense of exhaustion, as if I had passed through a long period of great mental exertion and danger.&#013;&#013;After all these dreams there remained on waking a remembrance of having been in a place very nearly dark, and of having spoken to people whom I could not see; and especially of one clear voice, of a female's, very deep, that spoke as if at a distance, slowly, and producing always the same sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear. Sometimes there came a sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck. Sometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and longer and more lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed itself. My heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and full drawn; a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation, supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion, in which my senses left me and I became unconscious.&#013;&#013;It was now three weeks since the commencement of this unaccountable state.&#013;&#013;My sufferings had, during the last week, told upon my appearance. I had grown pale, my eyes were dilated and darkened underneath, and the languor which I had long felt began to display itself in my countenance.&#013;&#013;My father asked me often whether I was ill; but, with an obstinacy which now seems to me unaccountable, I persisted in assuring him that I was quite well.&#013;&#013;In a sense this was true. I had no pain, I could complain of no bodily derangement. My complaint seemed to be one of the imagination, or the nerves, and, horrible as my sufferings were, I kept them, with a morbid reserve, very nearly to myself.&#013;&#013;It could not be that terrible complaint which the peasants called the oupire, for I had now been suffering for three weeks, and they were seldom ill for much more than three days, when death put an end to their miseries.&#013;&#013;Carmilla complained of dreams and feverish sensations, but by no means of so alarming a kind as mine. I say that mine were extremely alarming. Had I been capable of comprehending my condition, I would have invoked aid and advice on my knees. The narcotic of an unsuspected influence was acting upon me, and my perceptions were benumbed.&#013;&#013;I am going to tell you now of a dream that led immediately to an odd discovery.&#013;&#013;One night, instead of the voice I was accustomed to hear in the dark, I heard one, sweet and tender, and at the same time terrible, which said,&#013;&#013;&quot;Your mother warns you to beware of the assassin.&quot; At the same time a light unexpectedly sprang up, and I saw Carmilla, standing, near the foot of my bed, in her white nightdress, bathed, from her chin to her feet, in one great stain of blood.&#013;&#013;I wakened with a shriek, possessed with the one idea that Carmilla was being murdered. I remember springing from my bed, and my next recollection is that of standing on the lobby, crying for help.&#013;&#013;Madame and Mademoiselle came scurrying out of their rooms in alarm; a lamp burned always on the lobby, and seeing me, they soon learned the cause of my terror.&#013;&#013;I insisted on our knocking at Carmilla's door. Our knocking was unanswered.&#013;&#013;It soon became a pounding and an uproar. We shrieked her name, but all was vain.&#013;&#013;We all grew frightened, for the door was locked. We hurried back, in panic, to my room. There we rang the bell long and furiously. If my father's room had been at that side of the house, we would have called him up at once to our aid. But, alas! he was quite out of hearing, and to reach him involved an excursion for which we none of us had courage.&#013;&#013;Servants, however, soon came running up the stairs; I had got on my dressing gown and slippers meanwhile, and my companions were already similarly furnished. Recognizing the voices of the servants on the lobby, we sallied out together; and having renewed, as fruitlessly, our summons at Carmilla's door, I ordered the men to force the lock. They did so, and we stood, holding our lights aloft, in the doorway, and so stared into the room.&#013;&#013;We called her by name; but there was still no reply. We looked round the room. Everything was undisturbed. It was exactly in the state in which I had left it on bidding her good night. But Carmilla was gone.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;VIII&#013;&#013;Search&#013;&#013;At sight of the room, perfectly undisturbed except for our violent entrance, we began to cool a little, and soon recovered our senses sufficiently to dismiss the men. It had struck Mademoiselle that possibly Carmilla had been wakened by the uproar at her door, and in her first panic had jumped from her bed, and hid herself in a press, or behind a curtain, from which she could not, of course, emerge until the majordomo and his myrmidons had withdrawn. We now recommenced our search, and began to call her name again.&#013;&#013;It was all to no purpose. Our perplexity and agitation increased. We examined the windows, but they were secured. I implored of Carmilla, if she had concealed herself, to play this cruel trick no longer--to come out and to end our anxieties. It was all useless. I was by this time convinced that she was not in the room, nor in the dressing room, the door of which was still locked on this side. She could not have passed it. I was utterly puzzled. Had Carmilla discovered one of those secret passages which the old housekeeper said were known to exist in the schloss, although the tradition of their exact situation had been lost? A little time would, no doubt, explain all--utterly perplexed as, for the present, we were.&#013;&#013;It was past four o'clock, and I preferred passing the remaining hours of darkness in Madame's room. Daylight brought no solution of the difficulty.&#013;&#013;The whole household, with my father at its head, was in a state of agitation next morning. Every part of the chateau was searched. The grounds were explored. No trace of the missing lady could be discovered. The stream was about to be dragged; my father was in distraction; what a tale to have to tell the poor girl's mother on her return. I, too, was almost beside myself, though my grief was quite of a different kind.&#013;&#013;The morning was passed in alarm and excitement. It was now one o'clock, and still no tidings. I ran up to Carmilla's room, and found her standing at her dressing table. I was astounded. I could not believe my eyes. She beckoned me to her with her pretty finger, in silence. Her face expressed extreme fear.&#013;&#013;I ran to her in an ecstasy of joy; I kissed and embraced her again and again. I ran to the bell and rang it vehemently, to bring others to the spot who might at once relieve my father's anxiety.&#013;&#013;&quot;Dear Carmilla, what has become of you all this time? We have been in agonies of anxiety about you,&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Where have you been? How did you come back?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Last night has been a night of wonders,&quot; she said.&#013;&#013;&quot;For mercy's sake, explain all you can.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;It was past two last night,&quot; she said, &quot;when I went to sleep as usual in my bed, with my doors locked, that of the dressing room, and that opening upon the gallery. My sleep was uninterrupted, and, so far as I know, dreamless; but I woke just now on the sofa in the dressing room there, and I found the door between the rooms open, and the other door forced. How could all this have happened without my being wakened? It must have been accompanied with a great deal of noise, and I am particularly easily wakened; and how could I have been carried out of my bed without my sleep having been interrupted, I whom the slightest stir startles?&quot;&#013;&#013;By this time, Madame, Mademoiselle, my father, and a number of the servants were in the room. Carmilla was, of course, overwhelmed with inquiries, congratulations, and welcomes. She had but one story to tell, and seemed the least able of all the party to suggest any way of accounting for what had happened.&#013;&#013;My father took a turn up and down the room, thinking. I saw Carmilla's eye follow him for a moment with a sly, dark glance.&#013;&#013;When my father had sent the servants away, Mademoiselle having gone in search of a little bottle of valerian and salvolatile, and there being no one now in the room with Carmilla, except my father, Madame, and myself, he came to her thoughtfully, took her hand very kindly, led her to the sofa, and sat down beside her.&#013;&#013;&quot;Will you forgive me, my dear, if I risk a conjecture, and ask a question?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Who can have a better right?&quot; she said. &quot;Ask what you please, and I will tell you everything. But my story is simply one of bewilderment and darkness. I know absolutely nothing. Put any question you please, but you know, of course, the limitations mamma has placed me under.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Perfectly, my dear child. I need not approach the topics on which she desires our silence. Now, the marvel of last night consists in your having been removed from your bed and your room, without being wakened, and this removal having occurred apparently while the windows were still secured, and the two doors locked upon the inside. I will tell you my theory and ask you a question.&quot;&#013;&#013;Carmilla was leaning on her hand dejectedly; Madame and I were listening breathlessly.&#013;&#013;&quot;Now, my question is this. Have you ever been suspected of walking in your sleep?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Never, since I was very young indeed.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But you did walk in your sleep when you were young?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes; I know I did. I have been told so often by my old nurse.&quot;&#013;&#013;My father smiled and nodded.&#013;&#013;&quot;Well, what has happened is this. You got up in your sleep, unlocked the door, not leaving the key, as usual, in the lock, but taking it out and locking it on the outside; you again took the key out, and carried it away with you to some one of the five-and-twenty rooms on this floor, or perhaps upstairs or downstairs. There are so many rooms and closets, so much heavy furniture, and such accumulations of lumber, that it would require a week to search this old house thoroughly. Do you see, now, what I mean?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I do, but not all,&quot; she answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;And how, papa, do you account for her finding herself on the sofa in the dressing room, which we had searched so carefully?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;She came there after you had searched it, still in her sleep, and at last awoke spontaneously, and was as much surprised to find herself where she was as any one else. I wish all mysteries were as easily and innocently explained as yours, Carmilla,&quot; he said, laughing. &quot;And so we may congratulate ourselves on the certainty that the most natural explanation of the occurrence is one that involves no drugging, no tampering with locks, no burglars, or poisoners, or witches--nothing that need alarm Carmilla, or anyone else, for our safety.&quot;&#013;&#013;Carmilla was looking charmingly. Nothing could be more beautiful than her tints. Her beauty was, I think, enhanced by that graceful languor that was peculiar to her. I think my father was silently contrasting her looks with mine, for he said:&#013;&#013;&quot;I wish my poor Laura was looking more like herself&quot;; and he sighed.&#013;&#013;So our alarms were happily ended, and Carmilla restored to her friends.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;IX&#013;&#013;The Doctor&#013;&#013;As Carmilla would not hear of an attendant sleeping in her room, my father arranged that a servant should sleep outside her door, so that she would not attempt to make another such excursion without being arrested at her own door.&#013;&#013;That night passed quietly; and next morning early, the doctor, whom my father had sent for without telling me a word about it, arrived to see me.&#013;&#013;Madame accompanied me to the library; and there the grave little doctor, with white hair and spectacles, whom I mentioned before, was waiting to receive me.&#013;&#013;I told him my story, and as I proceeded he grew graver and graver.&#013;&#013;We were standing, he and I, in the recess of one of the windows, facing one another. When my statement was over, he leaned with his shoulders against the wall, and with his eyes fixed on me earnestly, with an interest in which was a dash of horror.&#013;&#013;After a minute's reflection, he asked Madame if he could see my father.&#013;&#013;He was sent for accordingly, and as he entered, smiling, he said:&#013;&#013;&quot;I dare say, doctor, you are going to tell me that I am an old fool for having brought you here; I hope I am.&quot;&#013;&#013;But his smile faded into shadow as the doctor, with a very grave face, beckoned him to him.&#013;&#013;He and the doctor talked for some time in the same recess where I had just conferred with the physician. It seemed an earnest and argumentative conversation. The room is very large, and I and Madame stood together, burning with curiosity, at the farther end. Not a word could we hear, however, for they spoke in a very low tone, and the deep recess of the window quite concealed the doctor from view, and very nearly my father, whose foot, arm, and shoulder only could we see; and the voices were, I suppose, all the less audible for the sort of closet which the thick wall and window formed.&#013;&#013;After a time my father's face looked into the room; it was pale, thoughtful, and, I fancied, agitated.&#013;&#013;&quot;Laura, dear, come here for a moment. Madame, we shan't trouble you, the doctor says, at present.&quot;&#013;&#013;Accordingly I approached, for the first time a little alarmed; for, although I felt very weak, I did not feel ill; and strength, one always fancies, is a thing that may be picked up when we please.&#013;&#013;My father held out his hand to me, as I drew near, but he was looking at the doctor, and he said:&#013;&#013;&quot;It certainly is very odd; I don't understand it quite. Laura, come here, dear; now attend to Doctor Spielsberg, and recollect yourself.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You mentioned a sensation like that of two needles piercing the skin, somewhere about your neck, on the night when you experienced your first horrible dream. Is there still any soreness?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;None at all,&quot; I answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;Can you indicate with your finger about the point at which you think this occurred?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Very little below my throat--here,&quot; I answered.&#013;&#013;I wore a morning dress, which covered the place I pointed to.&#013;&#013;&quot;Now you can satisfy yourself,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;You won't mind your papa's lowering your dress a very little. It is necessary, to detect a symptom of the complaint under which you have been suffering.&quot;&#013;&#013;I acquiesced. It was only an inch or two below the edge of my collar.&#013;&#013;&quot;God bless me!--so it is,&quot; exclaimed my father, growing pale.&#013;&#013;&quot;You see it now with your own eyes,&quot; said the doctor, with a gloomy triumph.&#013;&#013;&quot;What is it?&quot; I exclaimed, beginning to be frightened.&#013;&#013;&quot;Nothing, my dear young lady, but a small blue spot, about the size of the tip of your little finger; and now,&quot; he continued, turning to papa, &quot;the question is what is best to be done?&quot;&#013;&#013;Is there any danger?&quot;I urged, in great trepidation.&#013;&#013;&quot;I trust not, my dear,&quot; answered the doctor. &quot;I don't see why you should not recover. I don't see why you should not begin immediately to get better. That is the point at which the sense of strangulation begins?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes,&quot; I answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;And--recollect as well as you can--the same point was a kind of center of that thrill which you described just now, like the current of a cold stream running against you?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;It may have been; I think it was.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Ay, you see?&quot; he added, turning to my father. &quot;Shall I say a word to Madame?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Certainly,&quot; said my father.&#013;&#013;He called Madame to him, and said:&#013;&#013;&quot;I find my young friend here far from well. It won't be of any great consequence, I hope; but it will be necessary that some steps be taken, which I will explain by-and-by; but in the meantime, Madame, you will be so good as not to let Miss Laura be alone for one moment. That is the only direction I need give for the present. It is indispensable.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;We may rely upon your kindness, Madame, I know,&quot; added my father.&#013;&#013;Madame satisfied him eagerly.&#013;&#013;&quot;And you, dear Laura, I know you will observe the doctor's direction.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I shall have to ask your opinion upon another patient, whose symptoms slightly resemble those of my daughter, that have just been detailed to you--very much milder in degree, but I believe quite of the same sort. She is a young lady--our guest; but as you say you will be passing this way again this evening, you can't do better than take your supper here, and you can then see her. She does not come down till the afternoon.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;I thank you,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;I shall be with you, then, at about seven this evening.&quot;&#013;&#013;And then they repeated their directions to me and to Madame, and with this parting charge my father left us, and walked out with the doctor; and I saw them pacing together up and down between the road and the moat, on the grassy platform in front of the castle, evidently absorbed in earnest conversation.&#013;&#013;The doctor did not return. I saw him mount his horse there, take his leave, and ride away eastward through the forest.&#013;&#013;Nearly at the same time I saw the man arrive from Dranfield with the letters, and dismount and hand the bag to my father.&#013;&#013;In the meantime, Madame and I were both busy, lost in conjecture as to the reasons of the singular and earnest direction which the doctor and my father had concurred in imposing. Madame, as she afterwards told me, was afraid the doctor apprehended a sudden seizure, and that, without prompt assistance, I might either lose my life in a fit, or at least be seriously hurt.&#013;&#013;The interpretation did not strike me; and I fancied, perhaps luckily for my nerves, that the arrangement was prescribed simply to secure a companion, who would prevent my taking too much exercise, or eating unripe fruit, or doing any of the fifty foolish things to which young people are supposed to be prone.&#013;&#013;About half an hour after my father came in--he had a letter in his hand--and said:&#013;&#013;&quot;This letter had been delayed; it is from General Spielsdorf. He might have been here yesterday, he may not come till tomorrow or he may be here today.&quot;&#013;&#013;He put the open letter into my hand; but he did not look pleased, as he used when a guest, especially one so much loved as the General, was coming.&#013;&#013;On the contrary, he looked as if he wished him at the bottom of the Red Sea. There was plainly something on his mind which he did not choose to divulge.&#013;&#013;&quot;Papa, darling, will you tell me this?&quot; said I, suddenly laying my hand on his arm, and looking, I am sure, imploringly in his face.&#013;&#013;&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he answered, smoothing my hair caressingly over my eyes.&#013;&#013;&quot;Does the doctor think me very ill?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;No, dear; he thinks, if right steps are taken, you will be quite well again, at least, on the high road to a complete recovery, in a day or two,&quot; he answered, a little dryly. &quot;I wish our good friend, the General, had chosen any other time; that is, I wish you had been perfectly well to receive him.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But do tell me, papa,&quot; I insisted, &quot;what does he think is the matter with me?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Nothing; you must not plague me with questions,&quot; he answered, with more irritation than I ever remember him to have displayed before; and seeing that I looked wounded, I suppose, he kissed me, and added, &quot;You shall know all about it in a day or two; that is, all that I know. In the meantime you are not to trouble your head about it.&quot;&#013;&#013;He turned and left the room, but came back before I had done wondering and puzzling over the oddity of all this; it was merely to say that he was going to Karnstein, and had ordered the carriage to be ready at twelve, and that I and Madame should accompany him; he was going to see the priest who lived near those picturesque grounds, upon business, and as Carmilla had never seen them, she could follow, when she came down, with Mademoiselle, who would bring materials for what you call a picnic, which might be laid for us in the ruined castle.&#013;&#013;At twelve o'clock, accordingly, I was ready, and not long after, my father, Madame and I set out upon our projected drive.&#013;&#013;Passing the drawbridge we turn to the right, and follow the road over the steep Gothic bridge, westward, to reach the deserted village and ruined castle of Karnstein.&#013;&#013;No sylvan drive can be fancied prettier. The ground breaks into gentle hills and hollows, all clothed with beautiful wood, totally destitute of the comparative formality which artificial planting and early culture and pruning impart.&#013;&#013;The irregularities of the ground often lead the road out of its course, and cause it to wind beautifully round the sides of broken hollows and the steeper sides of the hills, among varieties of ground almost inexhaustible.&#013;&#013;Turning one of these points, we suddenly encountered our old friend, the General, riding towards us, attended by a mounted servant. His portmanteaus were following in a hired wagon, such as we term a cart.&#013;&#013;The General dismounted as we pulled up, and, after the usual greetings, was easily persuaded to accept the vacant seat in the carriage and send his horse on with his servant to the schloss.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;X&#013;&#013;Bereaved&#013;&#013;It was about ten months since we had last seen him: but that time had sufficed to make an alteration of years in his appearance. He had grown thinner; something of gloom and anxiety had taken the place of that cordial serenity which used to characterize his features. His dark blue eyes, always penetrating, now gleamed with a sterner light from under his shaggy grey eyebrows. It was not such a change as grief alone usually induces, and angrier passions seemed to have had their share in bringing it about.&#013;&#013;We had not long resumed our drive, when the General began to talk, with his usual soldierly directness, of the bereavement, as he termed it, which he had sustained in the death of his beloved niece and ward; and he then broke out in a tone of intense bitterness and fury, inveighing against the &quot;hellish arts&quot; to which she had fallen a victim, and expressing, with more exasperation than piety, his wonder that Heaven should tolerate so monstrous an indulgence of the lusts and malignity of hell.&#013;&#013;My father, who saw at once that something very extraordinary had befallen, asked him, if not too painful to him, to detail the circumstances which he thought justified the strong terms in which he expressed himself.&#013;&#013;&quot;I should tell you all with pleasure,&quot; said the General, &quot;but you would not believe me.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Why should I not?&quot; he asked.&#013;&#013;&quot;Because,&quot; he answered testily, &quot;you believe in nothing but what consists with your own prejudices and illusions. I remember when I was like you, but I have learned better.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Try me,&quot; said my father; &quot;I am not such a dogmatist as you suppose.&#013;&#013;Besides which, I very well know that you generally require proof for what you believe, and am, therefore, very strongly predisposed to respect your conclusions.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You are right in supposing that I have not been led lightly into a belief in the marvelous--for what I have experienced is marvelous--and I have been forced by extraordinary evidence to credit that which ran counter, diametrically, to all my theories. I have been made the dupe of a preternatural conspiracy.&quot;&#013;&#013;Notwithstanding his professions of confidence in the General's penetration, I saw my father, at this point, glance at the General, with, as I thought, a marked suspicion of his sanity.&#013;&#013;The General did not see it, luckily. He was looking gloomily and curiously into the glades and vistas of the woods that were opening before us.&#013;&#013;&quot;You are going to the Ruins of Karnstein?&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, it is a lucky coincidence; do you know I was going to ask you to bring me there to inspect them. I have a special object in exploring. There is a ruined chapel, ain't there, with a great many tombs of that extinct family?&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;So there are--highly interesting,&quot; said my father. &quot;I hope you are thinking of claiming the title and estates?&quot;&#013;&#013;My father said this gaily, but the General did not recollect the laugh, or even the smile, which courtesy exacts for a friend's joke; on the contrary, he looked grave and even fierce, ruminating on a matter that stirred his anger and horror.&#013;&#013;&quot;Something very different,&quot; he said, gruffly. &quot;I mean to unearth some of those fine people. I hope, by God's blessing, to accomplish a pious sacrilege here, which will relieve our earth of certain monsters, and enable honest people to sleep in their beds without being assailed by murderers. I have strange things to tell you, my dear friend, such as I myself would have scouted as incredible a few months since.&quot;&#013;&#013;My father looked at him again, but this time not with a glance of suspicion--with an eye, rather, of keen intelligence and alarm.&#013;&#013;&quot;The house of Karnstein,&quot; he said, &quot;has been long extinct: a hundred years at least. My dear wife was maternally descended from the Karnsteins. But the name and title have long ceased to exist. The castle is a ruin; the very village is deserted; it is fifty years since the smoke of a chimney was seen there; not a roof left.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Quite true. I have heard a great deal about that since I last saw you; a great deal that will astonish you. But I had better relate everything in the order in which it occurred,&quot; said the General. &quot;You saw my dear ward--my child, I may call her. No creature could have been more beautiful, and only three months ago none more blooming.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes, poor thing! when I saw her last she certainly was quite lovely,&quot; said my father. &quot;I was grieved and shocked more than I can tell you, my dear friend; I knew what a blow it was to you.&quot;&#013;&#013;He took the General's hand, and they exchanged a kind pressure. Tears gathered in the old soldier's eyes. He did not seek to conceal them. He said:&#013;&#013;&quot;We have been very old friends; I knew you would feel for me, childless as I am. She had become an object of very near interest to me, and repaid my care by an affection that cheered my home and made my life happy. That is all gone. The years that remain to me on earth may not be very long; but by God's mercy I hope to accomplish a service to mankind before I die, and to subserve the vengeance of Heaven upon the fiends who have murdered my poor child in the spring of her hopes and beauty!&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;You said, just now, that you intended relating everything as it occurred,&quot; said my father. &quot;Pray do; I assure you that it is not mere curiosity that prompts me.&quot;&#013;&#013;By this time we had reached the point at which the Drunstall road, by which the General had come, diverges from the road which we were traveling to Karnstein.&#013;&#013;&quot;How far is it to the ruins?&quot; inquired the General, looking anxiously forward.&#013;&#013;&quot;About half a league,&quot; answered my father. &quot;Pray let us hear the story you were so good as to promise.&quot;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XI&#013;&#013;The Story&#013;&#013;With all my heart,&quot; said the General, with an effort; and after a short pause in which to arrange his subject, he commenced one of the strangest narratives I ever heard.&#013;&#013;&quot;My dear child was looking forward with great pleasure to the visit you had been so good as to arrange for her to your charming daughter.&quot; Here he made me a gallant but melancholy bow. &quot;In the meantime we had an invitation to my old friend the Count Carlsfeld, whose schloss is about six leagues to the other side of Karnstein. It was to attend the series of fetes which, you remember, were given by him in honor of his illustrious visitor, the Grand Duke Charles.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Yes; and very splendid, I believe, they were,&quot; said my father.&#013;&#013;&quot;Princely! But then his hospitalities are quite regal. He has Aladdin's lamp. The night from which my sorrow dates was devoted to a magnificent masquerade. The grounds were thrown open, the trees hung with colored lamps. There was such a display of fireworks as Paris itself had never witnessed. And such music--music, you know, is my weakness--such ravishing music! The finest instrumental band, perhaps, in the world, and the finest singers who could be collected from all the great operas in Europe. As you wandered through these fantastically illuminated grounds, the moon-lighted chateau throwing a rosy light from its long rows of windows, you would suddenly hear these ravishing voices stealing from the silence of some grove, or rising from boats upon the lake. I felt myself, as I looked and listened, carried back into the romance and poetry of my early youth.&#013;&#013;&quot;When the fireworks were ended, and the ball beginning, we returned to the noble suite of rooms that were thrown open to the dancers. A masked ball, you know, is a beautiful sight; but so brilliant a spectacle of the kind I never saw before.&#013;&#013;&quot;It was a very aristocratic assembly. I was myself almost the only 'nobody' present.&#013;&#013;&quot;My dear child was looking quite beautiful. She wore no mask. Her excitement and delight added an unspeakable charm to her features, always lovely. I remarked a young lady, dressed magnificently, but wearing a mask, who appeared to me to be observing my ward with extraordinary interest. I had seen her, earlier in the evening, in the great hall, and again, for a few minutes, walking near us, on the terrace under the castle windows, similarly employed. A lady, also masked, richly and gravely dressed, and with a stately air, like a person of rank, accompanied her as a chaperon.&#013;&#013;Had the young lady not worn a mask, I could, of course, have been much more certain upon the question whether she was really watching my poor darling.&#013;&#013;I am now well assured that she was.&#013;&#013;&quot;We were now in one of the salons. My poor dear child had been dancing, and was resting a little in one of the chairs near the door; I was standing near. The two ladies I have mentioned had approached and the younger took the chair next my ward; while her companion stood beside me, and for a little time addressed herself, in a low tone, to her charge.&#013;&#013;&quot;Availing herself of the privilege of her mask, she turned to me, and in the tone of an old friend, and calling me by my name, opened a conversation with me, which piqued my curiosity a good deal. She referred to many scenes where she had met me--at Court, and at distinguished houses. She alluded to little incidents which I had long ceased to think of, but which, I found, had only lain in abeyance in my memory, for they instantly started into life at her touch.&#013;&#013;&quot;I became more and more curious to ascertain who she was, every moment. She parried my attempts to discover very adroitly and pleasantly. The knowledge she showed of many passages in my life seemed to me all but unaccountable; and she appeared to take a not unnatural pleasure in foiling my curiosity, and in seeing me flounder in my eager perplexity, from one conjecture to another.&#013;&#013;&quot;In the meantime the young lady, whom her mother called by the odd name of Millarca, when she once or twice addressed her, had, with the same ease and grace, got into conversation with my ward.&#013;&#013;&quot;She introduced herself by saying that her mother was a very old acquaintance of mine. She spoke of the agreeable audacity which a mask rendered practicable; she talked like a friend; she admired her dress, and insinuated very prettily her admiration of her beauty. She amused her with laughing criticisms upon the people who crowded the ballroom, and laughed at my poor child's fun. She was very witty and lively when she pleased, and after a time they had grown very good friends, and the young stranger lowered her mask, displaying a remarkably beautiful face. I had never seen it before, neither had my dear child. But though it was new to us, the features were so engaging, as well as lovely, that it was impossible not to feel the attraction powerfully. My poor girl did so. I never saw anyone more taken with another at first sight, unless, indeed, it was the stranger herself, who seemed quite to have lost her heart to her.&#013;&#013;&quot;In the meantime, availing myself of the license of a masquerade, I put not a few questions to the elder lady.&#013;&#013;&quot;'You have puzzled me utterly,' I said, laughing. 'Is that not enough?&#013;&#013;Won't you, now, consent to stand on equal terms, and do me the kindness to remove your mask?'&#013;&#013;&quot;'Can any request be more unreasonable?' she replied. 'Ask a lady to yield an advantage! Beside, how do you know you should recognize me? Years make changes.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'As you see,' I said, with a bow, and, I suppose, a rather melancholy little laugh.&#013;&#013;&quot;'As philosophers tell us,' she said; 'and how do you know that a sight of my face would help you?'&#013;&#013;&quot;'I should take chance for that,' I answered. 'It is vain trying to make yourself out an old woman; your figure betrays you.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'Years, nevertheless, have passed since I saw you, rather since you saw me, for that is what I am considering. Millarca, there, is my daughter; I cannot then be young, even in the opinion of people whom time has taught to be indulgent, and I may not like to be compared with what you remember me.&#013;&#013;You have no mask to remove. You can offer me nothing in exchange.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'My petition is to your pity, to remove it.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'And mine to yours, to let it stay where it is,' she replied.&#013;&#013;&quot;'Well, then, at least you will tell me whether you are French or German; you speak both languages so perfectly.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'I don't think I shall tell you that, General; you intend a surprise, and are meditating the particular point of attack.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'At all events, you won't deny this,' I said, 'that being honored by your permission to converse, I ought to know how to address you. Shall I say Madame la Comtesse?'&#013;&#013;&quot;She laughed, and she would, no doubt, have met me with another evasion--if, indeed, I can treat any occurrence in an interview every circumstance of which was prearranged, as I now believe, with the profoundest cunning, as liable to be modified by accident.&#013;&#013;&quot;'As to that,' she began; but she was interrupted, almost as she opened her lips, by a gentleman, dressed in black, who looked particularly elegant and distinguished, with this drawback, that his face was the most deadly pale I ever saw, except in death. He was in no masquerade--in the plain evening dress of a gentleman; and he said, without a smile, but with a courtly and unusually low bow:--&#013;&#013;&quot;'Will Madame la Comtesse permit me to say a very few words which may interest her?'&#013;&#013;&quot;The lady turned quickly to him, and touched her lip in token of silence; she then said to me, 'Keep my place for me, General; I shall return when I have said a few words.'&#013;&#013;&quot;And with this injunction, playfully given, she walked a little aside with the gentleman in black, and talked for some minutes, apparently very earnestly. They then walked away slowly together in the crowd, and I lost them for some minutes.&#013;&#013;&quot;I spent the interval in cudgeling my brains for a conjecture as to the identity of the lady who seemed to remember me so kindly, and I was thinking of turning about and joining in the conversation between my pretty ward and the Countess's daughter, and trying whether, by the time she returned, I might not have a surprise in store for her, by having her name, title, chateau, and estates at my fingers' ends. But at this moment she returned, accompanied by the pale man in black, who said:&#013;&#013;&quot;'I shall return and inform Madame la Comtesse when her carriage is at the door.'&#013;&#013;&quot;He withdrew with a bow.&quot;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XII&#013;&#013;A Petition&#013;&#013;&quot;'Then we are to lose Madame la Comtesse, but I hope only for a few hours,' I said, with a low bow.&#013;&#013;&quot;'It may be that only, or it may be a few weeks. It was very unlucky his speaking to me just now as he did. Do you now know me?'&#013;&#013;&quot;I assured her I did not.&#013;&#013;&quot;'You shall know me,' she said, 'but not at present. We are older and better friends than, perhaps, you suspect. I cannot yet declare myself. I shall in three weeks pass your beautiful schloss, about which I have been making enquiries. I shall then look in upon you for an hour or two, and renew a friendship which I never think of without a thousand pleasant recollections. This moment a piece of news has reached me like a thunderbolt. I must set out now, and travel by a devious route, nearly a hundred miles, with all the dispatch I can possibly make. My perplexities multiply. I am only deterred by the compulsory reserve I practice as to my name from making a very singular request of you. My poor child has not quite recovered her strength. Her horse fell with her, at a hunt which she had ridden out to witness, her nerves have not yet recovered the shock, and our physician says that she must on no account exert herself for some time to come. We came here, in consequence, by very easy stages--hardly six leagues a day. I must now travel day and night, on a mission of life and death--a mission the critical and momentous nature of which I shall be able to explain to you when we meet, as I hope we shall, in a few weeks, without the necessity of any concealment.'&#013;&#013;&quot;She went on to make her petition, and it was in the tone of a person from whom such a request amounted to conferring, rather than seeking a favor.&#013;&#013;This was only in manner, and, as it seemed, quite unconsciously. Than the terms in which it was expressed, nothing could be more deprecatory. It was simply that I would consent to take charge of her daughter during her absence.&#013;&#013;&quot;This was, all things considered, a strange, not to say, an audacious request. She in some sort disarmed me, by stating and admitting everything that could be urged against it, and throwing herself entirely upon my chivalry. At the same moment, by a fatality that seems to have predetermined all that happened, my poor child came to my side, and, in an undertone, besought me to invite her new friend, Millarca, to pay us a visit. She had just been sounding her, and thought, if her mamma would allow her, she would like it extremely.&#013;&#013;&quot;At another time I should have told her to wait a little, until, at least, we knew who they were. But I had not a moment to think in. The two ladies assailed me together, and I must confess the refined and beautiful face of the young lady, about which there was something extremely engaging, as well as the elegance and fire of high birth, determined me; and, quite overpowered, I submitted, and undertook, too easily, the care of the young lady, whom her mother called Millarca.&#013;&#013;&quot;The Countess beckoned to her daughter, who listened with grave attention while she told her, in general terms, how suddenly and peremptorily she had been summoned, and also of the arrangement she had made for her under my care, adding that I was one of her earliest and most valued friends.&#013;&#013;&quot;I made, of course, such speeches as the case seemed to call for, and found myself, on reflection, in a position which I did not half like.&#013;&#013;&quot;The gentleman in black returned, and very ceremoniously conducted the lady from the room.&#013;&#013;&quot;The demeanor of this gentleman was such as to impress me with the conviction that the Countess was a lady of very much more importance than her modest title alone might have led me to assume.&#013;&#013;&quot;Her last charge to me was that no attempt was to be made to learn more about her than I might have already guessed, until her return. Our distinguished host, whose guest she was, knew her reasons.&#013;&#013;&quot;'But here,' she said, 'neither I nor my daughter could safely remain for more than a day. I removed my mask imprudently for a moment, about an hour ago, and, too late, I fancied you saw me. So I resolved to seek an opportunity of talking a little to you. Had I found that you had seen me, I would have thrown myself on your high sense of honor to keep my secret some weeks. As it is, I am satisfied that you did not see me; but if you now suspect, or, on reflection, should suspect, who I am, I commit myself, in like manner, entirely to your honor. My daughter will observe the same secrecy, and I well know that you will, from time to time, remind her, lest she should thoughtlessly disclose it.'&#013;&#013;&quot;She whispered a few words to her daughter, kissed her hurriedly twice, and went away, accompanied by the pale gentleman in black, and disappeared in the crowd.&#013;&#013;&quot;'In the next room,' said Millarca, 'there is a window that looks upon the hall door. I should like to see the last of mamma, and to kiss my hand to her.'&#013;&#013;&quot;We assented, of course, and accompanied her to the window. We looked out, and saw a handsome old-fashioned carriage, with a troop of couriers and footmen. We saw the slim figure of the pale gentleman in black, as he held a thick velvet cloak, and placed it about her shoulders and threw the hood over her head. She nodded to him, and just touched his hand with hers. He bowed low repeatedly as the door closed, and the carriage began to move.&#013;&#013;&quot;'She is gone,' said Millarca, with a sigh.&#013;&#013;&quot;'She is gone,' I repeated to myself, for the first time--in the hurried moments that had elapsed since my consent--reflecting upon the folly of my act.&#013;&#013;&quot;'She did not look up,' said the young lady, plaintively.&#013;&#013;&quot;'The Countess had taken off her mask, perhaps, and did not care to show her face,' I said; 'and she could not know that you were in the window.'&#013;&#013;&quot;She sighed, and looked in my face. She was so beautiful that I relented. I was sorry I had for a moment repented of my hospitality, and I determined to make her amends for the unavowed churlishness of my reception.&#013;&#013;&quot;The young lady, replacing her mask, joined my ward in persuading me to return to the grounds, where the concert was soon to be renewed. We did so, and walked up and down the terrace that lies under the castle windows.&#013;&#013;Millarca became very intimate with us, and amused us with lively descriptions and stories of most of the great people whom we saw upon the terrace. I liked her more and more every minute. Her gossip without being ill-natured, was extremely diverting to me, who had been so long out of the great world. I thought what life she would give to our sometimes lonely evenings at home.&#013;&#013;&quot;This ball was not over until the morning sun had almost reached the horizon. It pleased the Grand Duke to dance till then, so loyal people could not go away, or think of bed.&#013;&#013;&quot;We had just got through a crowded saloon, when my ward asked me what had become of Millarca. I thought she had been by her side, and she fancied she was by mine. The fact was, we had lost her.&#013;&#013;&quot;All my efforts to find her were vain. I feared that she had mistaken, in the confusion of a momentary separation from us, other people for her new friends, and had, possibly, pursued and lost them in the extensive grounds which were thrown open to us.&#013;&#013;&quot;Now, in its full force, I recognized a new folly in my having undertaken the charge of a young lady without so much as knowing her name; and fettered as I was by promises, of the reasons for imposing which I knew nothing, I could not even point my inquiries by saying that the missing young lady was the daughter of the Countess who had taken her departure a few hours before.&#013;&#013;&quot;Morning broke. It was clear daylight before I gave up my search. It was not till near two o'clock next day that we heard anything of my missing charge.&#013;&#013;&quot;At about that time a servant knocked at my niece's door, to say that he had been earnestly requested by a young lady, who appeared to be in great distress, to make out where she could find the General Baron Spielsdorf and the young lady his daughter, in whose charge she had been left by her mother.&#013;&#013;&quot;There could be no doubt, notwithstanding the slight inaccuracy, that our young friend had turned up; and so she had. Would to heaven we had lost her!&#013;&#013;&quot;She told my poor child a story to account for her having failed to recover us for so long. Very late, she said, she had got to the housekeeper's bedroom in despair of finding us, and had then fallen into a deep sleep which, long as it was, had hardly sufficed to recruit her strength after the fatigues of the ball.&#013;&#013;&quot;That day Millarca came home with us. I was only too happy, after all, to have secured so charming a companion for my dear girl.&quot;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XIII&#013;&#013;The Woodman&#013;&#013;&quot;There soon, however, appeared some drawbacks. In the first place, Millarca complained of extreme languor--the weakness that remained after her late illness--and she never emerged from her room till the afternoon was pretty far advanced. In the next place, it was accidentally discovered, although she always locked her door on the inside, and never disturbed the key from its place till she admitted the maid to assist at her toilet, that she was undoubtedly sometimes absent from her room in the very early morning, and at various times later in the day, before she wished it to be understood that she was stirring. She was repeatedly seen from the windows of the schloss, in the first faint grey of the morning, walking through the trees, in an easterly direction, and looking like a person in a trance. This convinced me that she walked in her sleep. But this hypothesis did not solve the puzzle. How did she pass out from her room, leaving the door locked on the inside? How did she escape from the house without unbarring door or window?&#013;&#013;&quot;In the midst of my perplexities, an anxiety of a far more urgent kind presented itself.&#013;&#013;&quot;My dear child began to lose her looks and health, and that in a manner so mysterious, and even horrible, that I became thoroughly frightened.&#013;&#013;&quot;She was at first visited by appalling dreams; then, as she fancied, by a specter, sometimes resembling Millarca, sometimes in the shape of a beast, indistinctly seen, walking round the foot of her bed, from side to side.&#013;&#013;Lastly came sensations. One, not unpleasant, but very peculiar, she said, resembled the flow of an icy stream against her breast. At a later time, she felt something like a pair of large needles pierce her, a little below the throat, with a very sharp pain. A few nights after, followed a gradual and convulsive sense of strangulation; then came unconsciousness.&quot;&#013;&#013;I could hear distinctly every word the kind old General was saying, because by this time we were driving upon the short grass that spreads on either side of the road as you approach the roofless village which had not shown the smoke of a chimney for more than half a century.&#013;&#013;You may guess how strangely I felt as I heard my own symptoms so exactly described in those which had been experienced by the poor girl who, but for the catastrophe which followed, would have been at that moment a visitor at my father's chateau. You may suppose, also, how I felt as I heard him detail habits and mysterious peculiarities which were, in fact, those of our beautiful guest, Carmilla!&#013;&#013;A vista opened in the forest; we were on a sudden under the chimneys and gables of the ruined village, and the towers and battlements of the dismantled castle, round which gigantic trees are grouped, overhung us from a slight eminence.&#013;&#013;In a frightened dream I got down from the carriage, and in silence, for we had each abundant matter for thinking; we soon mounted the ascent, and were among the spacious chambers, winding stairs, and dark corridors of the castle.&#013;&#013;&quot;And this was once the palatial residence of the Karnsteins!&quot; said the old General at length, as from a great window he looked out across the village, and saw the wide, undulating expanse of forest. &quot;It was a bad family, and here its bloodstained annals were written,&quot; he continued. &quot;It is hard that they should, after death, continue to plague the human race with their atrocious lusts. That is the chapel of the Karnsteins, down there.&quot;&#013;&#013;He pointed down to the grey walls of the Gothic building partly visible through the foliage, a little way down the steep. &quot;And I hear the axe of a woodman,&quot; he added, &quot;busy among the trees that surround it; he possibly may give us the information of which I am in search, and point out the grave of Mircalla, Countess of Karnstein. These rustics preserve the local traditions of great families, whose stories die out among the rich and titled so soon as the families themselves become extinct.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;We have a portrait, at home, of Mircalla, the Countess Karnstein; should you like to see it?&quot; asked my father.&#013;&#013;&quot;Time enough, dear friend,&quot; replied the General. &quot;I believe that I have seen the original; and one motive which has led me to you earlier than I at first intended, was to explore the chapel which we are now approaching.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;What! see the Countess Mircalla,&quot; exclaimed my father; &quot;why, she has been dead more than a century!&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Not so dead as you fancy, I am told,&quot; answered the General.&#013;&#013;&quot;I confess, General, you puzzle me utterly,&quot; replied my father, looking at him, I fancied, for a moment with a return of the suspicion I detected before. But although there was anger and detestation, at times, in the old General's manner, there was nothing flighty.&#013;&#013;&quot;There remains to me,&quot; he said, as we passed under the heavy arch of the Gothic church--for its dimensions would have justified its being so styled--&quot;but one object which can interest me during the few years that remain to me on earth, and that is to wreak on her the vengeance which, I thank God, may still be accomplished by a mortal arm.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;What vengeance can you mean?&quot; asked my father, in increasing amazement.&#013;&#013;&quot;I mean, to decapitate the monster,&quot; he answered, with a fierce flush, and a stamp that echoed mournfully through the hollow ruin, and his clenched hand was at the same moment raised, as if it grasped the handle of an axe, while he shook it ferociously in the air.&#013;&#013;&quot;What?&quot; exclaimed my father, more than ever bewildered.&#013;&#013;&quot;To strike her head off.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Cut her head off!&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Aye, with a hatchet, with a spade, or with anything that can cleave through her murderous throat. You shall hear,&quot; he answered, trembling with rage. And hurrying forward he said:&#013;&#013;&quot;That beam will answer for a seat; your dear child is fatigued; let her be seated, and I will, in a few sentences, close my dreadful story.&quot;&#013;&#013;The squared block of wood, which lay on the grass-grown pavement of the chapel, formed a bench on which I was very glad to seat myself, and in the meantime the General called to the woodman, who had been removing some boughs which leaned upon the old walls; and, axe in hand, the hardy old fellow stood before us.&#013;&#013;He could not tell us anything of these monuments; but there was an old man, he said, a ranger of this forest, at present sojourning in the house of the priest, about two miles away, who could point out every monument of the old Karnstein family; and, for a trifle, he undertook to bring him back with him, if we would lend him one of our horses, in little more than half an hour.&#013;&#013;&quot;Have you been long employed about this forest?&quot; asked my father of the old man.&#013;&#013;&quot;I have been a woodman here,&quot; he answered in his patois, &quot;under the forester, all my days; so has my father before me, and so on, as many generations as I can count up. I could show you the very house in the village here, in which my ancestors lived.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;How came the village to be deserted?&quot; asked the General.&#013;&#013;&quot;It was troubled by revenants, sir; several were tracked to their graves, there detected by the usual tests, and extinguished in the usual way, by decapitation, by the stake, and by burning; but not until many of the villagers were killed.&#013;&#013;&quot;But after all these proceedings according to law,&quot; he continued--&quot;so many graves opened, and so many vampires deprived of their horrible animation--the village was not relieved. But a Moravian nobleman, who happened to be traveling this way, heard how matters were, and being skilled--as many people are in his country--in such affairs, he offered to deliver the village from its tormentor. He did so thus: There being a bright moon that night, he ascended, shortly after sunset, the towers of the chapel here, from whence he could distinctly see the churchyard beneath him; you can see it from that window. From this point he watched until he saw the vampire come out of his grave, and place near it the linen clothes in which he had been folded, and then glide away towards the village to plague its inhabitants.&#013;&#013;&quot;The stranger, having seen all this, came down from the steeple, took the linen wrappings of the vampire, and carried them up to the top of the tower, which he again mounted. When the vampire returned from his prowlings and missed his clothes, he cried furiously to the Moravian, whom he saw at the summit of the tower, and who, in reply, beckoned him to ascend and take them. Whereupon the vampire, accepting his invitation, began to climb the steeple, and so soon as he had reached the battlements, the Moravian, with a stroke of his sword, clove his skull in twain, hurling him down to the churchyard, whither, descending by the winding stairs, the stranger followed and cut his head off, and next day delivered it and the body to the villagers, who duly impaled and burnt them.&#013;&#013;&quot;This Moravian nobleman had authority from the then head of the family to remove the tomb of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, which he did effectually, so that in a little while its site was quite forgotten.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;Can you point out where it stood?&quot; asked the General, eagerly.&#013;&#013;The forester shook his head, and smiled.&#013;&#013;&quot;Not a soul living could tell you that now,&quot; he said; &quot;besides, they say her body was removed; but no one is sure of that either.&quot;&#013;&#013;Having thus spoken, as time pressed, he dropped his axe and departed, leaving us to hear the remainder of the General's strange story.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XIV&#013;&#013;The Meeting&#013;&#013;&quot;My beloved child,&quot; he resumed, &quot;was now growing rapidly worse. The physician who attended her had failed to produce the slightest impression on her disease, for such I then supposed it to be. He saw my alarm, and suggested a consultation. I called in an abler physician, from Gratz.&#013;&#013;Several days elapsed before he arrived. He was a good and pious, as well as a learned man. Having seen my poor ward together, they withdrew to my library to confer and discuss. I, from the adjoining room, where I awaited their summons, heard these two gentlemen's voices raised in something sharper than a strictly philosophical discussion. I knocked at the door and entered. I found the old physician from Gratz maintaining his theory. His rival was combating it with undisguised ridicule, accompanied with bursts of laughter. This unseemly manifestation subsided and the altercation ended on my entrance.&#013;&#013;&quot;'Sir,' said my first physician,'my learned brother seems to think that you want a conjuror, and not a doctor.'&#013;&#013;&quot;'Pardon me,' said the old physician from Gratz, looking displeased, 'I shall state my own view of the case in my own way another time. I grieve, Monsieur le General, that by my skill and science I can be of no use.&#013;&#013;Before I go I shall do myself the honor to suggest something to you.'&#013;&#013;&quot;He seemed thoughtful, and sat down at a table and began to write.&#013;&#013;Profoundly disappointed, I made my bow, and as I turned to go, the other doctor pointed over his shoulder to his companion who was writing, and then, with a shrug, significantly touched his forehead.&#013;&#013;&quot;This consultation, then, left me precisely where I was. I walked out into the grounds, all but distracted. The doctor from Gratz, in ten or fifteen minutes, overtook me. He apologized for having followed me, but said that he could not conscientiously take his leave without a few words more. He told me that he could not be mistaken; no natural disease exhibited the same symptoms; and that death was already very near. There remained, however, a day, or possibly two, of life. If the fatal seizure were at once arrested, with great care and skill her strength might possibly return. But all hung now upon the confines of the irrevocable. One more assault might extinguish the last spark of vitality which is, every moment, ready to die.&#013;&#013;&quot;'And what is the nature of the seizure you speak of?' I entreated.&#013;&#013;&quot;'I have stated all fully in this note, which I place in your hands upon the distinct condition that you send for the nearest clergyman, and open my letter in his presence, and on no account read it till he is with you; you would despise it else, and it is a matter of life and death. Should the priest fail you, then, indeed, you may read it.'&#013;&#013;&quot;He asked me, before taking his leave finally, whether I would wish to see a man curiously learned upon the very subject, which, after I had read his letter, would probably interest me above all others, and he urged me earnestly to invite him to visit him there; and so took his leave.&#013;&#013;&quot;The ecclesiastic was absent, and I read the letter by myself. At another time, or in another case, it might have excited my ridicule. But into what quackeries will not people rush for a last chance, where all accustomed means have failed, and the life of a beloved object is at stake?&#013;&#013;&quot;Nothing, you will say, could be more absurd than the learned man's letter.&#013;&#013;It was monstrous enough to have consigned him to a madhouse. He said that the patient was suffering from the visits of a vampire! The punctures which she described as having occurred near the throat, were, he insisted, the insertion of those two long, thin, and sharp teeth which, it is well known, are peculiar to vampires; and there could be no doubt, he added, as to the well-defined presence of the small livid mark which all concurred in describing as that induced by the demon's lips, and every symptom described by the sufferer was in exact conformity with those recorded in every case of a similar visitation.&#013;&#013;&quot;Being myself wholly skeptical as to the existence of any such portent as the vampire, the supernatural theory of the good doctor furnished, in my opinion, but another instance of learning and intelligence oddly associated with some one hallucination. I was so miserable, however, that, rather than try nothing, I acted upon the instructions of the letter.&#013;&#013;&quot;I concealed myself in the dark dressing room, that opened upon the poor patient's room, in which a candle was burning, and watched there till she was fast asleep. I stood at the door, peeping through the small crevice, my sword laid on the table beside me, as my directions prescribed, until, a little after one, I saw a large black object, very ill-defined, crawl, as it seemed to me, over the foot of the bed, and swiftly spread itself up to the poor girl's throat, where it swelled, in a moment, into a great, palpitating mass.&#013;&#013;&quot;For a few moments I had stood petrified. I now sprang forward, with my sword in my hand. The black creature suddenly contracted towards the foot of the bed, glided over it, and, standing on the floor about a yard below the foot of the bed, with a glare of skulking ferocity and horror fixed on me, I saw Millarca. Speculating I know not what, I struck at her instantly with my sword; but I saw her standing near the door, unscathed. Horrified, I pursued, and struck again. She was gone; and my sword flew to shivers against the door.&#013;&#013;&quot;I can't describe to you all that passed on that horrible night. The whole house was up and stirring. The specter Millarca was gone. But her victim was sinking fast, and before the morning dawned, she died.&quot;&#013;&#013;The old General was agitated. We did not speak to him. My father walked to some little distance, and began reading the inscriptions on the tombstones; and thus occupied, he strolled into the door of a side chapel to prosecute his researches. The General leaned against the wall, dried his eyes, and sighed heavily. I was relieved on hearing the voices of Carmilla and Madame, who were at that moment approaching. The voices died away.&#013;&#013;In this solitude, having just listened to so strange a story, connected, as it was, with the great and titled dead, whose monuments were moldering among the dust and ivy round us, and every incident of which bore so awfully upon my own mysterious case--in this haunted spot, darkened by the towering foliage that rose on every side, dense and high above its noiseless walls--a horror began to steal over me, and my heart sank as I thought that my friends were, after all, not about to enter and disturb this triste and ominous scene.&#013;&#013;The old General's eyes were fixed on the ground, as he leaned with his hand upon the basement of a shattered monument.&#013;&#013;Under a narrow, arched doorway, surmounted by one of those demoniacal grotesques in which the cynical and ghastly fancy of old Gothic carving delights, I saw very gladly the beautiful face and figure of Carmilla enter the shadowy chapel.&#013;&#013;I was just about to rise and speak, and nodded smiling, in answer to her peculiarly engaging smile; when with a cry, the old man by my side caught up the woodman's hatchet, and started forward. On seeing him a brutalized change came over her features. It was an instantaneous and horrible transformation, as she made a crouching step backwards. Before I could utter a scream, he struck at her with all his force, but she dived under his blow, and unscathed, caught him in her tiny grasp by the wrist. He struggled for a moment to release his arm, but his hand opened, the axe fell to the ground, and the girl was gone.&#013;&#013;He staggered against the wall. His grey hair stood upon his head, and a moisture shone over his face, as if he were at the point of death.&#013;&#013;The frightful scene had passed in a moment. The first thing I recollect after, is Madame standing before me, and impatiently repeating again and again, the question, &quot;Where is Mademoiselle Carmilla?&quot;&#013;&#013;I answered at length, &quot;I don't know--I can't tell--she went there,&quot; and I pointed to the door through which Madame had just entered; &quot;only a minute or two since.&quot;&#013;&#013;&quot;But I have been standing there, in the passage, ever since Mademoiselle Carmilla entered; and she did not return.&quot;&#013;&#013;She then began to call &quot;Carmilla,&quot; through every door and passage and from the windows, but no answer came.&#013;&#013;&quot;She called herself Carmilla?&quot; asked the General, still agitated.&#013;&#013;&quot;Carmilla, yes,&quot; I answered.&#013;&#013;&quot;Aye,&quot; he said; &quot;that is Millarca. That is the same person who long ago was called Mircalla, Countess Karnstein. Depart from this accursed ground, my poor child, as quickly as you can. Drive to the clergyman's house, and stay there till we come. Begone! May you never behold Carmilla more; you will not find her here.&quot;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XV&#013;&#013;Ordeal and Execution&#013;&#013;As he spoke one of the strangest looking men I ever beheld entered the chapel at the door through which Carmilla had made her entrance and her exit. He was tall, narrow-chested, stooping, with high shoulders, and dressed in black. His face was brown and dried in with deep furrows; he wore an oddly-shaped hat with a broad leaf. His hair, long and grizzled, hung on his shoulders. He wore a pair of gold spectacles, and walked slowly, with an odd shambling gait, with his face sometimes turned up to the sky, and sometimes bowed down towards the ground, seemed to wear a perpetual smile; his long thin arms were swinging, and his lank hands, in old black gloves ever so much too wide for them, waving and gesticulating in utter abstraction.&#013;&#013;&quot;The very man!&quot; exclaimed the General, advancing with manifest delight. &quot;My dear Baron, how happy I am to see you, I had no hope of meeting you so soon.&quot; He signed to my father, who had by this time returned, and leading the fantastic old gentleman, whom he called the Baron to meet him. He introduced him formally, and they at once entered into earnest conversation. The stranger took a roll of paper from his pocket, and spread it on the worn surface of a tomb that stood by. He had a pencil case in his fingers, with which he traced imaginary lines from point to point on the paper, which from their often glancing from it, together, at certain points of the building, I concluded to be a plan of the chapel. He accompanied, what I may term, his lecture, with occasional readings from a dirty little book, whose yellow leaves were closely written over.&#013;&#013;They sauntered together down the side aisle, opposite to the spot where I was standing, conversing as they went; then they began measuring distances by paces, and finally they all stood together, facing a piece of the sidewall, which they began to examine with great minuteness; pulling off the ivy that clung over it, and rapping the plaster with the ends of their sticks, scraping here, and knocking there. At length they ascertained the existence of a broad marble tablet, with letters carved in relief upon it.&#013;&#013;With the assistance of the woodman, who soon returned, a monumental inscription, and carved escutcheon, were disclosed. They proved to be those of the long lost monument of Mircalla, Countess Karnstein.&#013;&#013;The old General, though not I fear given to the praying mood, raised his hands and eyes to heaven, in mute thanksgiving for some moments.&#013;&#013;&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; I heard him say; &quot;the commissioner will be here, and the Inquisition will be held according to law.&quot;&#013;&#013;Then turning to the old man with the gold spectacles, whom I have described, he shook him warmly by both hands and said:&#013;&#013;&quot;Baron, how can I thank you? How can we all thank you? You will have delivered this region from a plague that has scourged its inhabitants for more than a century. The horrible enemy, thank God, is at last tracked.&quot;&#013;&#013;My father led the stranger aside, and the General followed. I know that he had led them out of hearing, that he might relate my case, and I saw them glance often quickly at me, as the discussion proceeded.&#013;&#013;My father came to me, kissed me again and again, and leading me from the chapel, said:&#013;&#013;&quot;It is time to return, but before we go home, we must add to our party the good priest, who lives but a little way from this; and persuade him to accompany us to the schloss.&quot;&#013;&#013;In this quest we were successful: and I was glad, being unspeakably fatigued when we reached home. But my satisfaction was changed to dismay, on discovering that there were no tidings of Carmilla. Of the scene that had occurred in the ruined chapel, no explanation was offered to me, and it was clear that it was a secret which my father for the present determined to keep from me.&#013;&#013;The sinister absence of Carmilla made the remembrance of the scene more horrible to me. The arrangements for the night were singular. Two servants, and Madame were to sit up in my room that night; and the ecclesiastic with my father kept watch in the adjoining dressing room.&#013;&#013;The priest had performed certain solemn rites that night, the purport of which I did not understand any more than I comprehended the reason of this extraordinary precaution taken for my safety during sleep.&#013;&#013;I saw all clearly a few days later.&#013;&#013;The disappearance of Carmilla was followed by the discontinuance of my nightly sufferings.&#013;&#013;You have heard, no doubt, of the appalling superstition that prevails in Upper and Lower Styria, in Moravia, Silesia, in Turkish Serbia, in Poland, even in Russia; the superstition, so we must call it, of the Vampire.&#013;&#013;If human testimony, taken with every care and solemnity, judicially, before commissions innumerable, each consisting of many members, all chosen for integrity and intelligence, and constituting reports more voluminous perhaps than exist upon any one other class of cases, is worth anything, it is difficult to deny, or even to doubt the existence of such a phenomenon as the Vampire.&#013;&#013;For my part I have heard no theory by which to explain what I myself have witnessed and experienced, other than that supplied by the ancient and well-attested belief of the country.&#013;&#013;The next day the formal proceedings took place in the Chapel of Karnstein.&#013;&#013;The grave of the Countess Mircalla was opened; and the General and my father recognized each his perfidious and beautiful guest, in the face now disclosed to view. The features, though a hundred and fifty years had passed since her funeral, were tinted with the warmth of life. Her eyes were open; no cadaverous smell exhaled from the coffin. The two medical men, one officially present, the other on the part of the promoter of the inquiry, attested the marvelous fact that there was a faint but appreciable respiration, and a corresponding action of the heart. The limbs were perfectly flexible, the flesh elastic; and the leaden coffin floated with blood, in which to a depth of seven inches, the body lay immersed.&#013;&#013;Here then, were all the admitted signs and proofs of vampirism. The body, therefore, in accordance with the ancient practice, was raised, and a sharp stake driven through the heart of the vampire, who uttered a piercing shriek at the moment, in all respects such as might escape from a living person in the last agony. Then the head was struck off, and a torrent of blood flowed from the severed neck. The body and head was next placed on a pile of wood, and reduced to ashes, which were thrown upon the river and borne away, and that territory has never since been plagued by the visits of a vampire.&#013;&#013;My father has a copy of the report of the Imperial Commission, with the signatures of all who were present at these proceedings, attached in verification of the statement. It is from this official paper that I have summarized my account of this last shocking scene.&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;&#013;XVI&#013;&#013;Conclusion&#013;&#013;I write all this you suppose with composure. But far from it; I cannot think of it without agitation. Nothing but your earnest desire so repeatedly expressed, could have induced me to sit down to a task that has unstrung my nerves for months to come, and reinduced a shadow of the unspeakable horror which years after my deliverance continued to make my days and nights dreadful, and solitude insupportably terrific.&#013;&#013;Let me add a word or two about that quaint Baron Vordenburg, to whose curious lore we were indebted for the discovery of the Countess Mircalla's grave.&#013;&#013;He had taken up his abode in Gratz, where, living upon a mere pittance, which was all that remained to him of the once princely estates of his family, in Upper Styria, he devoted himself to the minute and laborious investigation of the marvelously authenticated tradition of Vampirism. He had at his fingers' ends all the great and little works upon the subject.&#013;&#013;&quot;Magia Posthuma,&quot; &quot;Phlegon de Mirabilibus,&quot; &quot;Augustinus de cura pro Mortuis,&quot; &quot;Philosophicae et Christianae Cogitationes de Vampiris,&quot; by John Christofer Herenberg; and a thousand others, among which I remember only a few of those which he lent to my father. He had a voluminous digest of all the judicial cases, from which he had extracted a system of principles that appear to govern--some always, and others occasionally only--the condition of the vampire. I may mention, in passing, that the deadly pallor attributed to that sort of revenants, is a mere melodramatic fiction. They present, in the grave, and when they show themselves in human society, the appearance of healthy life. When disclosed to light in their coffins, they exhibit all the symptoms that are enumerated as those which proved the vampire-life of the long-dead Countess Karnstein.&#013;&#013;How they escape from their graves and return to them for certain hours every day, without displacing the clay or leaving any trace of disturbance in the state of the coffin or the cerements, has always been admitted to be utterly inexplicable. The amphibious existence of the vampire is sustained by daily renewed slumber in the grave. Its horrible lust for living blood supplies the vigor of its waking existence. The vampire is prone to be fascinated with an engrossing vehemence, resembling the passion of love, by particular persons. In pursuit of these it will exercise inexhaustible patience and stratagem, for access to a particular object may be obstructed in a hundred ways. It will never desist until it has satiated its passion, and drained the very life of its coveted victim. But it will, in these cases, husband and protract its murderous enjoyment with the refinement of an epicure, and heighten it by the gradual approaches of an artful courtship. In these cases it seems to yearn for something like sympathy and consent. In ordinary ones it goes direct to its object, overpowers with violence, and strangles and exhausts often at a single feast.&#013;&#013;The vampire is, apparently, subject, in certain situations, to special conditions. In the particular instance of which I have given you a relation, Mircalla seemed to be limited to a name which, if not her real one, should at least reproduce, without the omission or addition of a single letter, those, as we say, anagrammatically, which compose it.&#013;&#013;Carmilla did this; so did Millarca.&#013;&#013;My father related to the Baron Vordenburg, who remained with us for two or three weeks after the expulsion of Carmilla, the story about the Moravian nobleman and the vampire at Karnstein churchyard, and then he asked the Baron how he had discovered the exact position of the long-concealed tomb of the Countess Mircalla? The Baron's grotesque features puckered up into a mysterious smile; he looked down, still smiling on his worn spectacle case and fumbled with it. Then looking up, he said:&#013;&#013;&quot;I have many journals, and other papers, written by that remarkable man; the most curious among them is one treating of the visit of which you speak, to Karnstein. The tradition, of course, discolors and distorts a little. He might have been termed a Moravian nobleman, for he had changed his abode to that territory, and was, beside, a noble. But he was, in truth, a native of Upper Styria. It is enough to say that in very early youth he had been a passionate and favored lover of the beautiful Mircalla, Countess Karnstein. Her early death plunged him into inconsolable grief. It is the nature of vampires to increase and multiply, but according to an ascertained and ghostly law.&#013;&#013;&quot;Assume, at starting, a territory perfectly free from that pest. How does it begin, and how does it multiply itself? I will tell you. A person, more or less wicked, puts an end to himself. A suicide, under certain circumstances, becomes a vampire. That specter visits living people in their slumbers; they die, and almost invariably, in the grave, develop into vampires. This happened in the case of the beautiful Mircalla, who was haunted by one of those demons. My ancestor, Vordenburg, whose title I still bear, soon discovered this, and in the course of the studies to which he devoted himself, learned a great deal more.&#013;&#013;&quot;Among other things, he concluded that suspicion of vampirism would probably fall, sooner or later, upon the dead Countess, who in life had been his idol. He conceived a horror, be she what she might, of her remains being profaned by the outrage of a posthumous execution. He has left a curious paper to prove that the vampire, on its expulsion from its amphibious existence, is projected into a far more horrible life; and he resolved to save his once beloved Mircalla from this.&#013;&#013;&quot;He adopted the stratagem of a journey here, a pretended removal of her remains, and a real obliteration of her monument. When age had stolen upon him, and from the vale of years, he looked back on the scenes he was leaving, he considered, in a different spirit, what he had done, and a horror took possession of him. He made the tracings and notes which have guided me to the very spot, and drew up a confession of the deception that he had practiced. If he had intended any further action in this matter, death prevented him; and the hand of a remote descendant has, too late for many, directed the pursuit to the lair of the beast.&quot;&#013;&#013;We talked a little more, and among other things he said was this:&#013;&#013;&quot;One sign of the vampire is the power of the hand. The slender hand of Mircalla closed like a vice of steel on the General's wrist when he raised the hatchet to strike. But its power is not confined to its grasp; it leaves a numbness in the limb it seizes, which is slowly, if ever, recovered from.&quot;&#013;&#013;The following Spring my father took me a tour through Italy. We remained away for more than a year. It was long before the terror of recent events subsided; and to this hour the image of Carmilla returns to memory with ambiguous alternations--sometimes the playful, languid, beautiful girl; sometimes the writhing fiend I saw in the ruined church; and often from a reverie I have started, fancying I heard the light step of Carmilla at the drawing room door.&#013;&#013;",
